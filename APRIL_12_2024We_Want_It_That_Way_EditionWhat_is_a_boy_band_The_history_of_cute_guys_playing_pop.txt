LISTEN TO THIS EPISODE

Speaker A: Welcome to Hit Parade, a podcast of pop chart history from Slate magazine about the hits from coast to coast. Im Chris Melanthy, chart analyst, pop critic and writer of Slates. Why is this song #1 series on todays s show 25 years ago In April of 1999, a five boy five man vocal group from Orlando, Florida debuted on Billboard’s Hot 100 with what would become their most famous song, A confection co written by Swedish pop mastermind Max Martin. All five members of the group had vocal showcases on the track, fulfilling the crushes of their most ardent fans. They called themselves the Backstreet Boys and Max Martin called this lyrically inscrutable Diddy, I want it that way. What way? That way. When music fans hear the term boy band, they probably think of this group and maybe even this song. Or they think of the Backstreet Boys. Chief millennial rivals another Orlando formed five man group called NSyncNN. You. But the history of the boy band not only predates the Backstreet Boys and in sync versions of the boy band archetype existed before any of those performers were born. Boy bands are at least as old as rock and roll itself.

Speaker B: Rain Fall why fall in love? Why do fall in love?

Speaker A: Through the 50s, 60s and 70s, a variety of toothsome pin up worthy pop groups took periodic control of the charts, firing the fantasies of the young. Sometimes the groups were formed organically, sometimes prefabricated by producers. Some were even actual family bands.

Speaker B: One Bad apple Don’spoil the whole bunch girl oh give it one more try before you give up love.

Speaker A: By the 80s, the modern boy band took shape. An assembled group of usually five young men with cannily crafted material and shameless showmanship. Dancing kinetically, dressing fashionably, preening and twinkling for the camera and the teen magazines, and oh yeah, singing. These crush worthy objects could be black, white or even Latin. They invited you to choose your favorite member and learn their video choreography. Right into the 21st century, these cobbled together groups had the profiles of rock stars. We may have called them boy bands, but they carried themselves like rock bands. And by the 2010s and 2020s it was clear the future of the boy band may not even be in the West. Today on Hit Parade, we will try our best to define the ineffable qualities that make a band of boys a boy band. Hint, it’s mostly determined by the girls and we will celebrate this fizzy pop phenomenon that has produced decades of memorable chart hits, including a smash hit by an archetypal boy band that frequently tops polls of the greatest pop songs of all time. And thats where your hit parade marches today, the week ending January 31, 1970. When I want you back by the Jackson 5 reach number one on Billboards’s Hot 100. The Gary, Indiana brothers, first of four consecutive chart toppers as they became America’crush objects of the moment. Over half a century later, it’s still the most acclaimed song ever recorded by a boy band. And make no mistake, it was a boy band song every bit as much as I want it that way or Dynamite all pop classics. Was it the youthful vocals, the precision dance moves, the songwriting svenalis behind the scenes, all that and more. So grab a cup of milk everybody rock your body make a heart with your hands and let out a TRL scream While we consider what made boy bands larger than life. One, two, stick around. If we’re going to discuss what makes an act a boy band, right off the top, there’s a rather large elephant in the room we should address straight away. Were the Beatles the most acclaimed, most hit generating band of all time? A boy band Just call on me.

Speaker B: And I sen itone with love from me to you.

Speaker A: I imagine some of you are already scoffing at this idea. The Beatles wrote their own material. Youre saying okay. But as we noted in last months covers episode of Hit Parade, that wasnt universally true. And as well discuss later, several boy bands had songwriting members. The Beatles formed the band themselves. You might point out there wasn’t some s spvangali mastermind. True, but after they formed, the Beatles were directed by a manager, Brian Epstein, who told them what to wear and how to comport themselves on stage. And speaking of their onstage behavior, you might reasonably say the Beatles didn’t do dance moves. There was no choreography. Fair enough. But what were those mop top head shakes, the yeah yeah yes and those coordinated deep bows at the end of each song, but a kind of choreography? And about those songs, Paul McCartney admitted years later that he and John Lennin wrote their early hits to make girls squeal. Personal pronouns were their secret weapons. She loves you from me to you please please me Ps I love you.

Speaker B: Love forever Es I love you you.

Speaker A: Simply put, the media called the craze Beatle Mania and nicknamed the group the Fab Four for a reason. Without question, the Beatles fandom, especially in the early years, was boy band style fandom. In her 2020 boy band history, Larger than Life author and critic Maria Sherman says that the Beatles quote established the modern Boy band paradigm, unquote. She points out that like later boy bands, both the Beatles and their fans, overwhelmingly young girls, were disparaged, especially during the first wave of Beatlemania. The Fab Four were marketed not just for their music, but as for wall poster personalities, and they were the vehicle for a generation’s sexual awakening. The Beatles, Sherman writes, offered a framework that boy bands could build upon. I bring up the Beatles to expose some hard truths about our perceptions of boy bands. For one thing, there is no firm definition of a boy band. Even Sherman admits this in her book. There are boy bands that danced and some that did not love.

Speaker B: So in.

Speaker A: Boy bands that relied entirely on outside songwriters and those that wrote their own.

Speaker B: This is a second guess. This is the bottom line.

Speaker A: Boy bands assembled by managers, producers, or other industry architects, and quite a few that, like the Beatles, initially formed on their own bottom line. Boy bandness is in the eye and the ear of the beholder. The very term boy band has a murky history. Pop scholars date it to only the 1980s, based on an early interview with notorious boy band manager Lou Perlman, but it was likely arrived at organically, and the existence of boy bands predates the use of the term. The only thing boy bands have in common is rabid fandom by a young fan base. There are no firm borders that consign one act to boy band status and keep another group out. And speaking of borders, the other reason to trouble ourselves with the Beatles boy band question right up front is to exorcise some demons, specifically some isms, sexism, racism, and a favorite term of music critics, rockism first, sexism or the value of boy band’fans Ladies and gentlemen, beatles_ember those deafening screams hundreds of teenage girls at the Ed Sullivan show in February 1964 explain why the Beatles were disdained by reporters and critics at the time. One New Statesman commentator labeled Beatle fanse vacant faces the dull, the idol, the failures. These are the same girl screams that, more than 30 years later pierced the air outside the studios of MTV’s Total Request Live. At the turn of the millennium and the height of boy band fever, those.

Speaker B: Are the sights and sounds of Backstreeak mania. Welcome to Live mtv, the Backstreet Boys, live today here at our Times Square studio.

Speaker A: My point is, boy bands are not valueless because young girls like them, or for that matter, if they have a devoted LGBTQ fanbase. I’m with Harry Styles, who once told Rolling Stone. How can you say young girls don’t get it? They kind of keep the world going teenage girl fans don’t act too cool. They like you and they tell you unquote. Second point Racism or the Erasure of Boy Band Roots by their own admission, the Beatles were looking to emulate their heroes, who were primarily black performers. The Fab Four were generally good about giving props to their forebears, but of course the popularity of teen idols like the Beatles eclipsed that of the soul singers, doo wop troops and girl groups they covered and imitated. This pattern persisted deep into the boy band era. When white vocal groups were emulating or even directly covering prior black performers, they enjoyed more stratospheric popularity arguably as well. Discuss in a few moments the archetypal boy bands were people of color. Its fine to enjoy boy bands of all kinds, but but keep in mind, like rock and roll itself, the boy band is at its core rooted in black culture, and it’s easy for that archetype to be belittled or erased. Finally, and perhaps the most bedevveling ism for all boy ban rockm one thing.

Speaker B: I can tell is Got to be free together.

Speaker A: All the me the reason few people call the Beatles a boy band today indeed they mostly stopped calling them Mop Tops or the Fab Four by the late 60s was that they leaned into heavier rock, aged out of boyhood and gained rock credibility. This was a natural progression, but the idea that rock bands are valuable and pop acts value less persisted for decades. We critics gave this bias a name rockism, and it undermined the very premise of the boy band, even when the music was great. So while this is the last Il’ll discuss the Beatles in this episode, think about them as we walk through boy band history. The Fab Four were not only a model of how a boy band could gain legitimacy. Sadly, they also showed that that legitimacy could be weaponized against later generations harmonizing young men. In other words, if it wasn’t cool to call the Beatles garbage or disposable or fairies or worse in 1964, it’s not cool to denigrate New Addition and SinkC or One Direction or their fans in the decades that followed. Boy bands are a proud lineage. I with me baby now to trace the history of the boy band, we have to go back well before Beatlemania. In her boy band history, author Maria Sherman takes it way back to the 19th century and the first recorded mania for a musician, Listomania centered on handsome and virtuosic Hungarian composer Franz Listisz, who reportedly sent female fans hands into a frenzy in the 1840s it was seriously regarded as a medical condition. Women saved locs of liss hair and even his used cigars. But Franz Listz wasn’t a singer. And while he did write for men’s chorales as a performer, he was a solo act. In the rock era generally, the first true boy band as the term is understood today was a doo wopp group that literally called themselves the Teenagers.

Speaker B: Hard to find out tell of the ABCs make love.

Speaker A: The ABCs of love was by Frankie Lyman and the Teenagers who formed when the word teenager was still relatively new to the lexicon. And their sound was unique. A cross of early doo wop harmonizing with rock and roll energy topped by youthful lyrics. They were a multiracial group co led by a Puerto Rican singer, songwriter Herman Santiago, and fronted by the gifted black vocalist Frankie Lyman, who before anybody thought to invent the term boy band was singing on hit records when he was literally still a boy of 13 years old. The ABCs of love was one of Frankie Lyman and the Teenagers half dozen R and B hits. But the record that made them a number one on the R&B chart and a number six hit on Billboards pop charts in 1956 was the Immortal why Do Fools Fall in Love? Co written by Lyman and Santiago. The Teenagers career was short lived. Their hit making days were over by 1960 and Lyman himself, unable to cope with aging out of his boyhood fame, died of a drug overdose in 1968 at the age of 25. So Frankie Lyman and the Teenagers were both a proto boy band and a cautionary tale of the havoc such groups could wreak on their members. By the 60s, Motown had built a much sturdier model for harmonizing vocal groups. Though nobody would mistake them for boy bands, Motowns flagship mail troops like the Temptations and the Four Tops inspired generations of future boy bands with their close harmonies and their precision choreography. Hold that thought because Motown’actual boy bands were still to come. Meanwhile, in the wake of the Beatles, a team of producers in 1966 arguably invented the model for the prefabricated group. Like the later boy bands of the MTV era, this group was literally put together for the tube. First, the charts, second. We talked about the Monkeys in depth in our TV tunes edition of Hit Parate, manufactured by producers Bob Raiffelson and Bert Schneider. To capitalize on the Beatles success, the Monkeys launched in millions of American living rooms on NBC and scored an instant 1966/1 with last train to Clarksville. As a group built to be marketed the four Monkeys, Mickey Dolans, Davy Jones, Mike Nesmth and Peter Tork helped entrench the boy band concept of pick your favorite group member even more overtly than John, Paul, George and Ringo hat. The Monkeys even provided a template for the self referential boy band song. This is decades before Hanging tough or Backstreets back with the Monkeys TV shows opening theme song. As generations of Monkeys fans have pointed out, however, what started out prefab evolved into a genuine rock combo with hits that organically connected with the public. Massive smashes like the hot 100 numberh one im a believer penned by singer songwriter Neil Diamond.

Speaker B: Then I saw her face, Now I’m a Believer her trai.

Speaker A: And speaking of believers, a number one that was a vocal showcase for the cute one in the Monkeys. Their British member Davy Jones.

Speaker B: Daydream Believer Cheer of sleepg know what can it mean to a day Dramr.

Speaker A: The Monkeys fight to wrest control of their destiny from the producers who spawned them would echo in the stories of the millennial boy bands decades later. Around the time the Monkeys were commanding the charts from 1966 through 68, a group of actual brothers from Gary, Indiana were making their way through the talent show circuit in the Midwest. When they recorded for the independent local label SteelTown Records in 68, it was clear the Jackson brothers had talent. But nine year old Michael Jackson was the star. The Jacksons had been trying to get an audition at Motown in Detroit, but Motown founder Barry Gordy was resistant to signing a kid act. Eventually he was won over and the Jackson 5 signed to Motown. The Jackson brothers, including Jackie, Tito, Geermaine and Marlin backing up Michael could actually play. But leaving nothing to chance, Gordy assembled Motown players to back up the boys vocals and a crack team of songwriters that he called the corporation to write the group’s first Motown single in late 1969. Needless to say, everyone hit it out of the park. I want you BACK was more than an auspicious debut for a new pop act. Decades later, journalist Helen Brown called it arguably the greatest pop record of all time and certainly the fastest man made rout to pure joy. Pitchfork magazine called its chorus possibly the best chord progression in pop music history. In essence, I want you back set a new standard for boy band music. It came out of a music machine Motown with many cooks in the kitchen. But by showcasing Michaels vocals, all the brothers dance moves and their infectious energy, it made the band collectively a star. Motown fired up its promotional machine for the Jackson 5 as the brothers were emblazoned on buttons lunch boxes and teen magazine covers. After I want you back topped the Hot 100 in early 1970, it was quickly followed by three more number ones ABC, which simply interpolated the verse and chorus of I want you back and gave more of the brothers solo vocal lines. The love you save a riff on a long running public service message on safe driving. The life you save may be your own. In this one, Michael and Jermaine warn a fast moving girl to slow down.

Speaker B: D ###ow or someday you’be all.

Speaker A: And capping off the streak, the comforting ballad Ill be there which Michael Jackson later said was the song that showed audiences the Jackson 5 had potential beyond bubble guum pop.

Speaker B: Be there to protect you.

Speaker A: As we have noted in several episodes of Hit Parade, this streak of four number ones the Jackson 5 pulled off in 1970 was the most successful career launch in Hot 100 history to that date. The Jacksons would hold that record for more than two decades until Mariah Carey topped it with five has ones to launch her career in 1990 and 91. The Jackson 5 model would prove remarkably enduring across boy band history, a mix of giddy uptempo pop songs punctuated by tender ballads, all of them designed to whip up followers into a danceable frenzy or make them swoon. In the immediate wake of the Jackson 5 success, their sound was imitated by the Osmonds, another family band that had been toiling through the 60s including frequent appearances on the Andy Williams show, originally a quartet from Ogden Utah with barbershop style harmonies, the addition of younger brother Donnie Osmond Ban turned the osmonds into a five member boy band and their 1971 single One Bad Apple was originally written with the Jackson 5 in mind. Its hard to miss One Bad Apple not only topped the Hot 100 in February of 71, it blocked the actual Jackson fives own single Mama’s Pearl from reaching the top when Mama’s Pearl peekd at number two behind the Osmond. For that brief moment the Jacksons and the Osmonds had a real life boy band chart rivalry. The Jacksons family band approach was also emulated by groups like Canadian troupe the DeFranco family whose career was literally bankrolled by the editor of Tiger beat magazine. The DeFranco had their own would be Michael Jackson Donnie osmond with the 13 year old Tony DeFranco. Their 1973 single Heartbeat Its a Lovebeat reached number three. For their part, the Osmonds didnt stay with the Jackson 5 sound for long. They moved in a more rock oriented direction with hits like 1970 twos down by the Lazy River. In fact, there were several attempts to market straight up rock bands as if they were boy bands, including the Sweet and the raspberries in the mid-70s. The most successful was Scottish fivesome the Bay City Rollers. Their 1975 single Saturday Night climaxed with a chanted spelling of the word Saturday that invited teens to cheer or stomp along glamrock style. Saturday Night topped the Hot 100 the first week of 1976 and kicked off a two year run of hits for the Bay City Rollers. By the end of the 70s, with disco commanding the charts, the boy band sound was out of fashion. Even the Jackson 5 Whod left Motown for a new label and renamed themselves simply the Jacksons were proffering a fully adult dance floor sound as on their 1979/7 hit Shake your body down to the ground, setting up Michael Jacksons soon to explode solo stardom. So the boy band model would have to be rebooted for the 80s and that original Jackson 5 approach would prove remarkably durable. Though they proved influential on a generation of 80s and 90s boy bands, new Addition were not prefabricated by a producer. In 1978, grade schoolers Bobby Brown, Ricky Bell and Michael Bivens began singing together in the Roxbury section of Boston. Eventually they recruited two more vocalists, Ralph Trevant and Ronnie Devoe. The dynamic fivesome who punctuated their performances with hip hop style, popping and locking dance moves won a string of talent shows performing classics like the Jackson Fives, the love you Save and thats when a svenngali entered the picture. New Ed Addition were discovered at a talent show by one of the judges, Maurice Starr, a former singer, a writer, producer and a budding impresario. Star signed the group when they were only 13 to 15 years of age with the vision of making them into a new Jackson 5. True to his word, Star launched the project with a track he co wrote himself that was like an 80s version of ABC. Candy Girl led by the impossibly high vocals of Ralph Trevant was released on Maurice Stars own small Streetwise label and topped Billboards’r and b chart in 1983, a major coup for an independent imprint. While still under Stars auspices, New Ed Addition scored two more black radio hits. A similarly uptempo record called Popcorn Love hit has 25 R&B and a yearning ballad is this the end reached number 8 R&B. But New Ed Addition and Maurice Star quickly had a falling out over money and the group was now a hot enough commodity that major labels were interested. The five teenagers wriggled out of their reportedly rapacious contract with Star and signed with MCA Records, which achieved something Star had never managed. Crossing over New Edition on the pop Charts.

Speaker B: Now watch out gonna.

Speaker A: In the fall of 1984, new edition dropped their self titled major label debut album, led off by the single Cool It Now. The group had credibly matured while remaining cuddly and teen friendly. And in case their army of new fans needed help picking a favorite member of New Edition on the songs Rap Break, Ralph Trevant provided a handy roster.

Speaker B: Ronnie, Bobby, Ricky and Mike if I.

Speaker A: Love the girl who cares who you.

Speaker B: Like.

Speaker A: By the start of 1985, Cool it now reached number four on the Hot 100 new editions, first ever top 40 pop hit, as well as number one on the R and B chart for the follow up. As further evidence of mcas prioritization of New Edition, they got one of the hottest artist producers of the time to work with them, Ray Parker Jr. Who was just coming off his monster hit Ghostbusters.

Speaker B: If something strange in your neighborhood who you gonna call?

Speaker A: For New Edition, Parker wrote and produced Mr. Telephone Man, a classic please Mr. Postman style heartbreak jam. Like Coolit now, it scaled both the Hot 100 and R&B charts, reaching has 12, pop has 1, R&B. New Edition were filling a major gap in boy band fandom in the mid-80s, at least among groups singing in English. Their only serious competition at the time was a famed Puerto Rican boy band who never had a permanent lineup. New Addition might have started young, but they were not forced out of their boy band when they reached age 16. We discussed Menudo in our Latin pop episode of Hit Parade. The Spanish language juggernaut was launched in 1977 by producer Edrgardo Diaz, who as a policy routinely replaced Minudos members well before they reached adulthood. Minudo had already cycled through multiple lineups by 1984 when their songs started seeing some very modest airplay on US Radio stations. Capitalizing on this attention and a relative dearth of boy bands other than new edition, in 1984 Menudo tried recording in English. It helped that their then current lineup featured future megastar Ricky Martin. Then only 13. Hold Me managed a number 62 peak in 1985, but the Anglo crossover of Menudo never really took hold.

Speaker B: As.

Speaker A: So, having the field largely to themselves, New Addition kept scoring hits. But as they aged, the hits got smaller on the pop side, 1980s a little bit of Love is All It Takes barely cracked the top 40 at number 38. After founding New Edition member Bobby Brown left the group for a solo career, New Edition replaced him with singer Johnny Gill and retooled as a new jack swing group under the guidance of producers Jimmy Jam and Terry Lewis. They are 1988 single if it Isnt t Love managed to crack the pop top 10. But new addition now rightly bore little resemblance to their boy band origins.

Speaker B: Why I Feel this why does she stay on my mind?

Speaker A: Even before his ouster as new additions manager later Maurice Star had an idea to create a rival boy band to New Edition and this time the group would be made up of white performers. A bold gambit for a black manager. By the mid-80s creating this rival group became Stars sole focus and unlike New Edition, this would be fully his brainchild. He recruited five white boys from across Boston, including a pair of brothers from Dorchester, Donnie and Mark Wahlberg. Donnie stayed but Mark left and he had them record R and B leaning material. It took more than one album and a bunch of singles but eventually Stars prot became huger than even he he could have imagined. New Kids on Theock, Donnie Wahlberg, Jordan Knight, John Knight, Danny wood and Joey McIntyre were the first multi platinum boy band the yardstick for what teen pop groups would eventually become by the turn of the millennium. But it took years for them to take off. Maice Star at first tried promoting New Kids as an R and B act and their 1986 debut was a flop on first release. Their follow up LP was looking like a dud too until the bubble sol ballad please dont go Girl caught on at a few radio stations and climbed to number 10 on the Hot 100 in 1988.

Speaker B: Best friend girl.

Speaker A: The album it came from Hanging Tough released in the summer of 88, wound up spending more than two years on the charts and spun off a slew of top ten hits including the number three dance hit you got it, better known by its parenthetical the right stuff.

Speaker B: Alled was.

Speaker A: The plush ballad Ill ll be loving you forever. New Kids first number one hit Light hip hop jam Hang in Tougff another number one which was a self referential new kids dance that updated the idea of the Monkeys theme for a new generation and if usnna come right back.

Speaker B: And you know it.

Speaker A: It up and the pure pop of Covergirl which reached number two in the fall of 89 more than a year after the Hang and Tugff album launched.

Speaker B: She like Girl.

Speaker A: By the time New Kids on the Block were ready to release a follow up album Hang Andtugff was eight times platinum. ###um their 1986 debut had gone triple platinum. Belatedly, the group had sold hundreds of millions in merch, including lunchboxes and even dolls. And pre orders for their next album were at 2 million. But new kids falloff was remarkably swift.

Speaker B: Girl.

Speaker A: Step Step by Step the title track to New Kids 1990 album topped the Hot 100 for three weeks. But the album was number one for only one week and sold less than half as many copies as its predecessor. The group would score only two more top 20 singles before going on hiatus in 1990. By then, New Kids on the Block had fallen so far in perceived coolness that they were recording under the humbling acronym nkotb. In short, New Kids set both positive and negative boy band benchmarks. They exemplified the rapid half life of a blockbuster boy band. How a group that seems effortlessly trendy one year or two could become irredeemably cheesy as the boy band’fans mature. By the way, just as NKOTB were sliding off the charts, Donnie Wahlbergs brother Mark, who decided not to become a new Kid, scored his own number one hit as the rapper Marky Mark. Boy bands can have some funky spin offs. The early 90s was another wilderness period for the boy band in the era of grunge and gangsta rap. After New Kids Fall off, the only multi platinum selling group that even resembled a boy band were an R and B quartet that aged out of that identity almost immediately. Funnily enough, they were named after a New Edition song, Boys to Men, a vocal quartet that formed at a Philadelphia high school in the late 80s. Not only named themselves after the 1988 New Edition song Boys to Men, they were discovered by New Edition member Michael Bivens who in 1990 had launched a New Edition spin off group, the more hip hop forward bell Biv Deve. Michael Bivens became Boys to Mens manager and got them signed to Motown, the legendary label that had ink incubated the Jackson 5. Truthfully, the most boy band moment in Boys to Mens entire career was their debut single Motown Philly. A very meta dramatically heightened tale of the groups formation. It took the self consciousness of the boy band archetype and kicked it up several notches. Even Michael Biven had a cameo in.

Speaker B: The songo these jack real smooth on a hby chip nick mike sh wa.

Speaker A: Know the mentality motown Philly reached number three on the hot 100 in the summer of 1991. The bigger reason Boysz to Men became important to Boy band history, however, was what they inspired. Their singles were vocal showcases, setting new benchmarks for harmony, singing and vocal arranging. Several future boy band members of the late 90s admitted they aspired to the vocal fireworks on boys to men’s singles like the late 1991 has two hit its so hard to say goodbye to Yesterday.

Speaker B: Goodbyeday.

Speaker A: While Boys to Men were known early on for their dancing and stylish outfits, as their hits got bigger they graduated into the premier sole group of their generation, calling them a boy band. By the time of their chart topping weeper End of the road in 1992 already felt reductive. If I may invoke something I said in our Brit pop episode of Hit Parade, you might say Boys to Men were to boy bands in the 90s what Radiohead were to Brit pop. Important to the development of the form but also transcending the category entirely, Boys to Men simply werent boys for long. Their emergence into manhood was built into their name. The fallow period for boy bands persisted into the middle of the decade. In 1994 the multiracial Los Angeles Quartet all for One momentarily became chart commanders when their R and B cover of the country ballad I swear spent 11 weeks at number one.

Speaker B: Moon and the star star.

Speaker A: All for one scored a handful of hits but were more boyish than Boy band like never inspiring the kind of pin up poster fandom of a new edition or new kids. In the UK the mid-90s was a fairly golden time for boy banand with such chart topping pop troops as East 17, Wet Wet Wet and most especially Take that who scored multiple British number ones.

Speaker B: I just want Back for.

ADVERTISEMENT

Speaker A: But in America Take that only managed a single hit Back for good a UK has one reached has seven in America in 1995, but take that never touched the hot 100 again. By 1996 former Millie Vanilli mastermind Frank Farrion was even trying to spawn a Latin flavored boy band with a trio of American singers he called no Mercy. Their Europ pop flavored single where do you Go was a major global hit in 1996, including number five on the Hot 100. But no mercy had trouble following it up and didn’t become major personalities. What finally brought back the boy band in the late 90s was a family trio that both defied boy band stereotype and yet were boldly, shamelessly pop. Like all good boy bands, they provoked rabid love and furious loathing. But that may just have been a misreading of their breakthrough hit, which on the surface sounded like Nonsense Hansen were three brothers from Tulsa, Oklahoma, guitarist Isaac Hanseson, keyboardist Taylor Hanseson and drummer Zach Hansen. All three also harmonized, with Taylor typically taking lead vocals. The brothers co wrote their big hit MBOP, which topped both the Hot 100 in the spring of 1997 and at years end the Village Voice PA and Joop Critics Poll as 1997’s best single even as some rock fans decried the song as drivel. Stereog gu Tom Bryan in his column the Number Ones called Mapp perhaps the finest example of bubblegum gibberish to come along during my lifetime. And it turns out that the rest of MBOP is all weirdly wise life advice. Mbop was so massive three weeks at number one off a quadruple platinum debut album that it is widely credited for spawning the teen pop and boy band renaissance of the late 90s. The Hansen brothers were briefly teamen beat Crush Objects, but Hanseson’s big moment proved almost as difficult to follow up as those by all for One, Take that and no Mercy Hanns follow up hit the 70s style rave up wears the love peaked at number 27. As it turned out, the boy band break_rough of 1997 was real, but it would not sound like Hansen. And as MBOP was tumbling down the Hot 100, another boy band single was rising and it sounded a lot more like the future. One of the great ironies of boy band history is that the two best selling acts, Backstreet Boys and NS Sync, rival groups that leap to listeners minds the instant you say boy band, were both created by the same shadowy svangali SL conman. That man was Lou Perlman, who was inspired to get into the boy band game by New Kids on the block. In the 80s Perlman ran a business chartering blimps and private jets. When manager Maury Starr chartered a jet in 1989 for his the New Kids, Perlman realized how absurdly lucrative boy bands could be and he moved his business to Orlando, Florida. To tap the Disney town’s wealth of talent, Perlman formed the Backstreet Boys. First, he named them after an Orlando flea market, the Backstreet Market, where teenagers hung out. The five good looking and vocally adept young men, Nick Carter, Howie Durrow, AJ McLan and cousins Brian Luttrell and Kevin Richardson signed with Perlman in 1993 and released their first single, Weve Got It Going on in 1995. We touched on Backstreets history in our Hit Parade episode on Britney Spears and Max Martin, the Swedish songwriting mastermind who was behind much of 90s American teen pop and who by the way, as of 2024 now possesses more Hot 100 number one songwriting credits than anyone save for Paul McCartney. Max Martin Co wrote We’ve Got It Going on with his mentor Dennis Pop and it sounded like two Scandinavians approximating the sound of American R and B. In Europe, where purepop always did better, Backstreet’debut single was a hit. Weve Got It Going on went top five across the continent and even in the UK. But in backstreets homeland, boy bands in 1995, half a decade after the peak of New Addition and New Kids were nowhere. We’ve Got It Going on peaked on the Hot 100 at number 69. This backstreet backstory is vital to understanding how different the group’s reception was two years later. By 1997, with the millennial generation entering their years, American radio was shifting away from Generation X, alt rock, New Jack, swing and gangster rap toward shinier teen pop. After Hansen’number one hit mapp, the airwaves were safe for boy bands again.

Speaker B: My Heart.

Speaker A: The Backstreet Boys finally broke through on the Hot 100 with Quit Playing Games with My Heart, co written once again by Max Martin. It turned out that mid tempo balladry, not the wannabe R and B of weve ve got it going on was an easier sell for US audiences. Quit playing games peaked at number two in the late summer of 97 just as the Backstreet Boys self titled debut album finally reached US music stores. The album spawned a second hit right away with the similarly romantic as long as you love me Don’care are.

Speaker B: What you did as long as you love me.

Speaker A: This radio only track reached number four on Billboards radio songs chart. As we discussed in our great war against the single episode of Hit Parade, Backstreet’label Jive records was looking to sell as many full length cds as possible. It wasnt until backstreet’ third us top 40 hit that they scored with their original white R and B sound while offering their own entry into the history of self referential boy band songs. Everybody sees Backstreet’back was a head scratcher for American audiences. Wasn’t this group on their debut album what was Backstreet back from? The song was written by Max Martin and Dennis Pop largely to hype up Backstreet’s international fans who’d given the group multiple hits in 1995 and 90. But the song felt incongruous on Backstreet’$2 1997 US debut. Which is why Jive Records President Barry Weiss didn’t want to release the tune as a single. He even initially kept it off the US album. But when Canadian radio stations and some nearby US stations started playing Everybody Backstreetts back on their own, Weiss relented. He added the song to a 1998 reissue of the American Backstreet Boys CD as a sing. ###le Backstreets Back reached number four on the Hot 100 in May of 98, a sign that the Backstreet Boys were now established hitmakers approaching their imperial peak. It was around this time that Backstreet got their first serious competition from that aforementioned other boy band also launched by the wily loop. Perlman. NYNC were started by Perlman back in 1995 when he was waiting for Backstreet to find an audience. Perlman figured that if Backstreet were successful theyd have competition so why not create a Backstreet rival himself. He connected with Orlando college student Chris Kirkpatrick, who wanted to start his own singing group and backed by Perlman, recruited four more members to NSync, Justin Timberlake and JC Chazet Whod both briefly been cast members on Disneys the new Mickey Mouse Club alongside fellow future teen idols Britney Spears and Christina Aguilera and budding Orlando singers Joey Faton and Lance Bass. NSYNC rehearsed, recorded and performed for two years before their self titled debut came out first in Europe in 1997 then in America in 1998. Taran up my heart and eventual has 15 US radio hit defined NSync’sound co written once again by Max Martin and his Swedish colleagues, it was a bit more R and B forward than Backstreet sound but paired easily with the new shiny boy band style. When N Sync finally issued their debut retail single I want you back, no relation to the Jackson 5 classic, it scaled the Hot 100 along/side the Backstreet Boys peaking at number 13. Then later that year, as we discussed in our Britney Spears episode, both Backstreet and NSYNC were given a major boost by MTV. In the fall of 98 the video channel merged two of its prior daytime programs, Total Request a daily video countdown of clips requested by viewers and MTV Live a daily broadcast from the channels Times Square headquarters in New York City. The new afterool show with the portmanteau title Total Request live or TRL for short hosted by 25 year old Carson Daly, was a countdown on live TV. Steroids screaming teenagers would pile into Times Square either inside MTVs fishbowl like Studio or out on the street shrieking for favorite pop stars and their videos. And the boy bands were instant attractions.

Speaker B: Please welcome me.

Speaker A: Theyre performing the number one video on.

Speaker B: Total Request Live inync doing Tearing up.

Speaker A: My Heart guys between N Sync and Backstreet Boys, plus the new teen sensation Britney Spears whose debut single Baby One More Time launched nearly simultaneously with trl.

Speaker B: My killing.

Speaker A: Team Pop had a hammerlock on the program both on the dial MTV countdown and in their Times Square studio. Not long after TRL launched, NSync scored their first ever US top 10 hit with the ballad God Must have Spent a Little More time on you which peaked at number eight. By then the boy band pool was getting crowded. A four man vocal group from Los Angeles by way of O Ohio, 98 Degrees had made their chart debut a year before TRL. Their single Invisible man peaked at number 12 in the summer of 1997. But after TRL, 98 Degrees, fronted by textbook non threatening boys Nick and Drew Lachey became regular denizens of billboards top 10. Their late 98 single because of you climbed to number three on the hot 100. This presence of second tier megastars like 98 degrees indicated that America was nearing peak. Boy band. That peak really kicked off in the spring of 1999 when the Backstreet Boys readied the release of their second US and third European album Millennium. Anything Backstreet put out in the wake of their chart explosion was bound to do well, but the group stacked the deck by leading the album with one of Max Martins greatest and most nonsensical pop songs. Rolling Stone later called I Want it that Way a genre transcending classic. Other critics agreed even as they poked fun at Max Martins inscrutable lyrics. Martin and his Swedish co writer Andreas Carlson never revealed what that is, but the sterling melody overcame those quibbles. I Wanted that Way not only routinely ranks as Backstreet Boys most beloved song, it often makes the upper reaches of poles of the greatest boy band songs and even greatest pop songs of all time. What Way that way Me never wanna.

Speaker B: Hear it that way in mind.

ADVERTISEMENT

Speaker A: Because Jive Records elected not to issue I Want it that Way as a retail single in America, the song peaked at a fairly modest number six on the Hot 100 in the late spring of 99. But withholding the singleuredd thousands of Backstreet Boys fans would be compelled to buy the full length CD instead. This gambit worked massively. Backstreet Boys millennium opened to 1.1 million copies in its first week, the largest week for any album ever to that date. The huge launch of Millennium kicked off one of the physiest pop summers in Hot 100. Backstreet presided over a 1999 hit parade consisting of English language Latin pop from Ricky Martin, more sensual teen pop from Christina Aguilera.

Speaker B: With Baby There’a Price to.

Speaker A: I’m a in botle percolating hip hop flavored R and B from Destinys’s Child, aggro Dude bro rap rock from the likes of Limp Biscuit, who often went head to head with the boy bands on the daily TRL countdown, and even third tier boy band pop from the short lived Light Funky Ones or LFO Summer Girls. Their dopey ode to new kids on the block, bad Chinese food and young ladies who wear Abercrombie and Fitch peaked at number three. But the Backstreet Boys lorded over all that summer, selling the most cds, dominating the TRL countdown and setting the pace for millennial pop. The Millennium album went on to sell 13 million copies and it defined the zeitgeist as Y2K approached. For all the success the millennial boy bands were experiencing, industry politics were roiling beneath the surface. Simply put, Lou Perlman was ripping off both groups he spawned. The members of the Backstreet Boys freed themselves from his clutches first. In 1998, they sued Perlman for fraud, claiming hed kept most of their money and treated them as indentured servants. By 1999, NYINKCS members followed suit, revealing that Perlman had himself written into NSYC’contracts as a sixth member of the group and took the spoils while the five actual members had been living on $35 a day each even after selling millions of records. The NSYNC case dragged on through 1999 even as both groups were enjoying imperial chart success. Later that year, at the 1999 MTV Video Music Awards, boy bands were the major attraction and for the VMAS host comedian Chris Rock an easy target. While poking good natured fun at the reigning kings of pop, rock slipped in a pointed racial critique.

Speaker B: Same thing always goes on in music. Black man does something, 15 years later white man does the same thing and it makes a lot more money. That’s right. What else going on? Boy groups N Sync, Backstreet Boys.

Speaker A: Backstreet Boys Y.

Speaker B: Backstreet Bo they from the backrees.

Speaker A: Whooo.

Speaker B: I’m scared of that neighborhood Backreet Boys s***. Why would you wa wantna do that? Didn’t you see D Kids on the Block? Don’t you know how this move is gonna end.

Speaker A: With hindsight. Chris Rock did call the peak before the fall of the millennial boy band. He just called it about a year to a year and a half early. After NSYNC freed themselves from Lou Perlman, settling their contract and re signing with Jive Records, they had the opportunity to celebrate their freedom while besting the Backstreet Boys with one more chart benchmark. NSync recorded their second album no Strings Attached while they were extricating themselves from their original contract. The album title and cover art in which the five sinkers played puppets alluded to them no longer being under Lou Perlmans control. So did the albums lead single Bye by Bye, which doubled as both a romantic kiss off song and a screw u to Perlman, an instant top five hit By by by let fans behind the curtain on NSYNC plight and reminded them just how long it had been since the group had issued a full CD of new material. When no Strings Attached finally In March of 2000, it obliterated the sales record set just the year before by their rivals the Backstreet Boys. No strings attached sold 2.4 million copies in its first week, more than doubling millenniums 1999 sales mark after buy buy by peaked at number four, the follow up single, co written by Max Martin himself and his stable of Swedish songwriters, went all the way to the top of the Hot 100 in the summer of 2000. The meme tastic its gonna be me. The Backstreet Boys, for their part, were no slouches in 2000. They followed up Millennium straight away with the album Black and Blue in December. Black and Blue opened to 1.6 million in sales in its first week, a number that would have been mind blowing a year earlier but now fell short of NSYNCs seemingly unbeatable record. The Backstreet Albums lead single, an attempt to recreate the I wanted that way magic called Shape of My Heart topped out at number nine.

Speaker B: I was trying to someone it seemed.

Speaker A: The air was finally leaking from the boy band balloon. You could tell when TVS2 leading primetime animated series both satirized boy bands within eight months of each other. First south park with a summer 2000 episode about Eric Cartmans would be boy band finger banang Finger bang bang bang.

Speaker B: Finger bang bang bang bang bang I gonna finger bang bang you into my.

Speaker A: Left Followed by the Simpsons with a winter 2001 episode featuring Bart Simpson and his schoolmates in a boy band military industrial scheme called the Party Posse.

Speaker B: Not at the Spelling Bee.

Speaker A: Nsync provided guest voices for that Simpsons episode, eager to show they were in on the joke. You might say that was also the premise of what turned out to be NSync’s final album celebrity. On its lead single Pop, the group took aim at their critics who were debasing the boy band for their populous music. Sang Justin Timberlake sick and tired of hearing all these people talk about whats the deal with this pop life and when is it gonna fade out. The fade out was already happening. In the summer of 2001 celebrity opened to 1.7 million do in starting sales but it was out of the number one spot in just one week. The pop single stalled at number 19 on the Hot 100 and the CD never produced a chart topping hit. On their way to the exit, NSYNC set up Justin Timberlake as a breakout star and a credible R and B singer. The soul ballad Gone did almost as well on Billboards R and B chart as it did on the pop chart. Peeking just outside the top 10 on both charts and the album’final single Girlfriend featuring rapper Nellly was a legit hip hop dance track. Celebrity’biggest single Girlfriend made the pop top five and number 23 on the are and B char and then the millennial boy band moment was over. Both of the leading bands went on hiatus. Backstreet boys for about three years and SN seemingly permanently in 2002, the same year Justin Timberlake dropped his solo debut Justified. To no ones surprise, Timberlake picked right up with the R and B forward sound in sync had been refining on their final singles in the 2000s. The charts did a hard pivot from teen pop to hip hop. The few harmony groups that did well in the early aughts barely resembled Teen Pop. For example, 112, an R& B quartet on Sean Combs Bad Boy label that had been scoring hit since 1996, scored their biggest hit in 2001 in the wake of the boy band implosion. Peaches and Cream, a number four hit, gave boy band energy but was far more ribbled and laced with innuendo than Anything buy and SinkC B2K, a quartet that evolved out of the former kiddy band Immature and featured the vocals and show stopping dance moves of heartthrob omarian, topped the Hot 100 in early 2003 with the playfully edgy Bump bump bump.

Speaker B: Seeab.

Speaker A: The Latin pop world was also producing its share of top selling pop troops in the gap between maneu “o and regeton. The Dominican American group Aventura led by future bachata king Romeo Santos, infused American R and B into bachata on heartick singles like Obsession. And as in the mid-70s heyday of the Bay City Rollers, certain mid aughts rock bands were marketed as de facto boy bands. Emo pop stars, Fallout Boy were frequent denizens of MTV’s TRL Countdown and inspired a similar frenzy in the years after Backstreet and NSYNC left the scene. One Bullet Ultimately, it was a different kind of pop rock combo that finally filled the boy band gap in the late Augts. And like the Jacksons, the Osmonds and Hansen before them, they sprung organically from a musical family. The Jonas Brothers Kevin, Joe and Nick Jonas were raised in Wyckoff, New Jersey by a former ordained minister father and a mother who homeschooled them. Youngest brother Nick Jonas had even done some Broadway acting. After signing to Columbia Records, the label put them on tour with acts like the revived Backstreet Boys, but like Hansen, the Jonas Brothers played instruments. Their 2006 debut album, Its About Time generated a top 40 hit in early 2007 with a cover of the UK pop hit Year 3000. But the Jonaseses also generated some of their material in house. Nick Jonas was a budding songwriter, with contributions from Kevin and Joe. Later in 07, the Jonas Brothers first top 20 pop hit, so S was entirely authored by Nick. By 2008, fandom for the Jonaseses had reached a frenzy fueled in part by the TV fame of Joe Jonas, whod acted alongside his brothers in the Disney Channel movie Camp Rock. The brothers became teen beat obsessions for everything from their dating exploits. Joe was briefly an item with a teenage Taylor Swift to their pious backgrounds and wearing of purity rings, an abstinence totem. When the Jonas Brothers dropped their album A Little Bit Longer in the summer of 2008, it debuted at number one with over a half million in first week sales, remarkable at a time post Napster when CD sales were down across the board. Its lead single, Burnin up, co written by all three Jonas Brothers, debuted at number five on the Hot 100 and sold nearly 2 million copies on iTunes. The rise of the Jonas Brothers, who would continue scoring hits both together and solo into the 2010s, showed how the vertically integrated music business had advanced in the 21st century. Even since the era of Backstreet and NSync, it was now possible for an organic band of boys like the Jonases to be worked through the nexus of iTunes, downloads, targeted TV shows and pop merchandising. But could that system build a boy band from scratch? In 2010, famed music impresario and reality TV personality Simon Cowell was about to test that premise out on the British edition of his music competition franchise, the X Factor, where Simon was wowed by a teenage Harry Styles. How are you?

Speaker B: Hello.

Speaker A: Nice to meet you. Whats your name?

Speaker B: I’Harry Stileles.

Speaker A: OK. Okay, Harry, how old are you?

Speaker B: I’m 16.

Speaker A: So what are you doing here today?

ADVERTISEMENT

Speaker B: Well, I’ve always wanted to audition, but I’ve always been too young.

Speaker A: Okay. All right. When are you gonna sing?

Speaker B: I’ll do Isn’t she lovely by Stevie Wonder.

Speaker A: Okay. Good luck.

Speaker B: Isn’t she lovely? Isn’t she wonderfuloe?

Speaker A: The story of the formation of One Direction is now etched into boy band legend Simon Cowell and his fellow X Factor judge Nicole Schrzinger literally pieced together a boy band quintet out of five solo competitors on the UK X Factor. Nial Haran, Zane Malick, Liam Payne, Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson. The show even captured footage of Cowell and his fellow judges assembling One Direction in real time. That looks good.

Speaker B: That looks great.

Speaker A: It looks unbelievable.

Speaker B: That looks great.

Speaker A: I like that.

Speaker B: That looks great. Weve only four already.

Speaker A: Okay, Zay, now that is a good idea. Oh, God. Thats the category I want. Just then. As inorganic as this process seemed, revealing its workings to the public only seemed to stoke affection for the group that teen fans dubbed 1D. When One Direction lost the X Factor competition in the final round, it even made one D into something of an underdog. Fans now had a stake in their success. It helped that Cowell, who signed One Direction to his own Psycho records imprint, ensured 1D had top tier material. What makes you beautiful, a 2012 single written by Swedish and American songwriters affiliated with Max Martin studio, topped the UK chart and reached number four in the US remarkable as 1D had been created on the British X Factor, not the American edition, the song expressed a message, according to boy band historian Maria Sherman, that every young girl needed to hear. You dont know youre beautiful.

Speaker B: See everyone else but you light up.

ADVERTISEMENT

Speaker A: Leaving nothing to chance, the groups management booked One Direction on the Today show for a performance in front of 15,000 screaming fans. That paid off when the single made the highest Hot 100 debut by a British act in over a decade. One Direction went on to dominate boy band pop in the first half of the 2010s. From 2012 through 2014, 1D became the first band in Billboard history to have their first four albums debut at number one. Up all night, which spawned the what makes you beautiful single Take Me Home which generated the number three Hot 100 hit live, while were Young Midnight Memories which generated the number two hit Best Song Ever, a song influenced by and paying homage to the Whos Baba Oreilly.

Speaker B: Never into every Now I Cant go.

Speaker A: And the fourth album 4 which produced the anthemic has 13 hit Steal My Girl. One Direction help helped keep the boy band arena open in the 2010s and made space for other acts with an exuberant rock leaning pop sound. In 2014, an Australian band that opened for 1D on tour 5 Seconds of Summer made their debut with the single she Looks so Perfect, a frothy rock song that gave what makes you beautiful vibes. The One Direction connection got five seconds of summer or five Sos pronounced five sauce to number one on the billboard album chart with their self titled debut album. As for 1D, after one more album in 2015, the number two peaking made in the AM which finally broke their streak of chart toppers. One Direction pulled one last top three single with Drag Me Down.

Speaker B: Nobody Can.

Speaker A: Drag Me down and then announced a hiatus. The break was spawned in part by the departure of Zane Malik, who went on to a more R and B leaning solo career. And of course Harry Stileles was ready to spread his wings as a soloist. His debut single, the classic rock ballad Sign of the times, arrived in 2017. By then the boy band energy had shifted not only away from America and England, but out of the global west entirely. Arguably after One Direction it never really went back through the 90s and aughts, right through the 2010s. While all this boy band froth was going on in America, South Korea was building an entire industry that would take the world by storm. While this podcast episode cannot possibly do justice to the rich history of Korean pop music or K Pop, its worth going back briefly to K Pops Big bang moment in 1992 when the trio so Taiji and Boys performed their single N Adayo or I Know on a televised talent competition. The country had never seen anything quite like this. A group that sang and rapped, dressed in hip hop fashion and executed breakdance adjacent moves. Consider right through the 70s and most of the 80s, South Korea had banned rock music and most pop that the military government considered non positive. The media dubbed Sotaiji and Boys the Korean New Kids on the Block and they scored a bunch of hits in South Korea through the mid-90s. This was a eureka moment for the Korean entertainment industry which barely existed at the time. As Yi Hong, author of the definitive history the Birth of Korean cool put it, if Korea wanted a pop music industry, it was going to have to create it from the ground up. The business organized itself into a handful of vertically integrated conglomerates that would sign young stars to strict years long contracts, training and evaluating them in everything from singing and smiling for the camera to dancing with locksp precision. Uni Hong points out that compared to Korean pop acts, Western boy band dance_ancer look sloppy and free form. Speaking of the West, Korean pop only began to draw American and European attention in the 2000s when rain, a chiseled pop star broke out internationally. Rain even became a running source of bemused fascination on Stephen Colberts Comedy Central show the Colbert Ra. As Uni Hong put it, raign videos were the first that bore what came to be the K pop stamp. Highly artistic direction, stylized sets as if the video were taking place in the matrix and ingeniously choreographed. As exceptional as Rain was, however, by the late aughts and early tens the K pop industry relied more on so called idle groups like tv, xq, Girls Generation and Super Junior. Still, K Pop was essentially Nowhere on the US charts until the fluke 2012 success OFSI whose horsey dance YouTube hit Gangnam Style we have discussed on several prior Hit Parade episodes, peaking at number two on the Hot 100 in the fall of 2012, Gangnam Style primed US listeners to hear Korean lyrics and K pop production styles on the radio and iTunes. PSI was atypical of the Korean idol creation model, but there was now space created for a more dynamic group to fill. And this is where the bullet proof boy scouts in Korean BTS came in as their debut single no More Dream made clear BTS did not start out as purep pop. The seven man group who go by the pseudonyms rm, Jin, Suga, J, Hope, Jimin V and Jungkook launched with a sound closer to American gangster rap. Even the K pop press found BTS unapproachable at first. But more than any other prior K pop act, BTS put in the work to make themselves legible to Western audiences, mounting annual U.S. tours and evolving their sound into a hybrid of bouncy pop and trap era rap. Their devoted fanbase, the BTS army, spread outside Korea to encompass millions of US K pop aficionados. In 2017, BTS became the first K pop group to crack the American Top 40 when a remix of their song Mic Drop featuring New York rapper designer reached has 28. By 2018, BTS had converted into emo hip hop crossed with electrop pop and their single Fake Love was promoted by their American record label Columbia Records directly to US radio stations. Sonically, BTS were now light years past what any hit Western boy band had attempted before.

Speaker B: Fake a laug Fake a laug so.

ADVERTISEMENT

Speaker A: Fake a laugake la Fake Love and its album set several chart benchmarks when they arrived in the early summer of 2018. The album Love Yourself tier, part of a multi album Love Yourself series, debuted at the top of the Billboard 200, giving BTS K pops first ever American has one album and the Fake Love single debuted at number 10, making it the first top 10 hit by a K pop group six years after soloist PSI reached the American top 10 with Gangnam Style. As the BTS sound kept evolving, they racked up hit albums and occasionally hit singles, driven mostly by downloads and streams by BTS army fans. In 2019, Boy With Love, a collaboration with the American singer Halsey, debuted on the hot 100 at number eight. Boy with love sounded more American friendly than any prior BTS single, but its chart success relied largely on the groups devoted fanbase. Both Fake Love and Boy With Love spent less than two months each on the Hot 100, unable to convert army worship into widespread radio play or consumption by casual listeners. Even as BTS albums continued to debut at number one, BTs were, you might say, a blockbuster pop act a majority of Americans were rarely or never hearing. In 2020 BTS decided to do something about that. After years of recording almost entirely in Korean, sprinkled with brief English phrases, BTS chose to record their first all English single at the height of the COVID pandemic. They wanted their all English debut to be escapist and catchy and they put the word out through the US label Columbia that they wanted an exciting tempo driven pop song. The result was a truly global production written by a pair of British songwriters, David Stewart and Jessica Gombar. Shepherded by an American record label and recorded by South Koreas leading pop ambassadors. They called it Dynamite. Expertly riding the wave of neo disco pop a la Dualipa and Ariana Grande that was then ruling the charts, Dynamite sounded like it belonged everywhere, including the US airwaves. When Dynamite debuted at number one on the Hot 100 in September 2020, it became not only the first American chart topper for bts, it bested Size Gangnam Style to be K Pops first US number one period. In the months that followed, BTS racked up multiple hot 100 has ones including life Goes on, their first American chart topper sung largely in Korean and the following year. The propulsive butter, which spent 10 weeks atop the Hot 100 and took the title as Billboards Official 2021 Song of the summer. No boy band of any nationality had ever commanded the Hot 100 that long with that many number one hits. In the half decade since BTS breakthrough, more than a half dozen other case pop acts have topped the Billboard 200 album chart, including the boy bands Super M, Tomorrow Together and Stray Kids. These acts have a limited US radio and Hot 100 profile, but they command the charts thanks to a devoted fanbase who buy multiple copies of the acts CDS to receive cover art celebrating their favorite band member. In other words, the old boy band ethos of pick your favorite, pioneered in the days of the monkeys and the Jackson 5 is alive and well. And by the way, several of K Pops American album chart toppers are girl groups like Blackpink Twice and New Jeans. Which raises the question what about girl groups? Dont t they have a rich chart history? Hold that thought because well be covering them in a future hit parade episode. As for the western style boy band, perhaps the most surprising thing about these bands that seem to have built in sell by dates that supposedly become passe before their fans ever leave high school is that they never really go away. In 2019, the Jonas Brothers, now all in their late 20s and 30s, scored their first ever Hot 100 number one hit with Suckerr. The Jonuses also scored a number one album that year, as did the Backstreet boys. And in 2023 NSync announced they had reunited to record a song for the Trolls animated movie franchise that has long featured Justin Timberlake as a voice actor. The song from Trolls Band Together, titled Better place reached number 25 on the Hot 100 and even cracked the top 10 on the Adult Contemporary chart. Because of course the original NSYNC fanbase are now in their 30s and 40s.

Speaker B: Sky.

Speaker A: Will the NS sync reunion last? Its anyones guess, but last month when Justin Timberlake released his latest solo album, Everything I Thought It Was, the track that generated the most excitement on social media was paradise, featuring vocals from Justins old boy bandmates. NYNC even joined Timberlake at a Los Angeles concert for a surprise reunion performing paradise plus a medley of NSYNC hits.

Speaker B: Fight hereon this moment between you and I.

Speaker A: And thats the thing about boy bands. They are fused with our happiest memories as music fans. Each generation, really, each half generation gets a boy band or two to call their own. As with any music that peaks on the charts during our adolescence, nothing not even aging out of the teen pop demographic will abridge that fondness. So when the Backstreet Boys tour now, as you might say, Backstreet Men, and they pull out their greatest hit, do me a favor. If you know this one, if you know this one, sing it at the top of your lungs for me, okay? For just a moment, an audience remembers the time when their pop idol meant the world to them. It’s a poster on the wall of our memory palace that can never be taken down. I hope you enjoyed this episode of Hit Parade. ARA was written, edited and narrated by Chris Meanthe. Thats me.
