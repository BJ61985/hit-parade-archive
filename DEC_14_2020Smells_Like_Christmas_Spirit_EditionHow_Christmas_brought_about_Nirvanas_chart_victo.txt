S3: Welcome to Hit Parade, a podcast of pop chart history from Slate magazine about the hits from coast to coast. I’m Chris Melaniphy, chart analyst, pop critic and writer of Slate’s Why Is This Song No. One series on today’s show? Happy holidays from all of us at Hit Parade in this pandemic plagued holiday.

S4: I hope you are finding ways to celebrate with your bubble of loved ones.

S3: Even in 2020. This holiday can still be about togetherness, of course, given what a garbage fire of a year this has been. Perhaps it’s more apropos to celebrate 1991 style when this was the way thousands of American teenagers were saying Merry Christmas.

S5: Nirvanas Landmark 1991 album, Never Mind, might not sound like a holiday album, and this is not going to be one of those conversations where I try to convince you, never mind, is secretly a Christmas album. The way some folks insist Die Hard is a Christmas movie. But speaking just for myself 29 years later, I still think of the 1991 holiday season when I think of Nirvana’s breakthrough, it wasn’t just because I was home from college and playing the album to death that December. It’s because of what happened less than a week after New Year’s Day, 1992, the hottest new rock band in the country right now, Nirvana on the latest export from the thriving Seattle music scene Nirvana and their second album, Nevermind, becoming number one just after Christmas 1991.

S1: Nevermind did the improbable. It topped the Billboard 200 album chart. What made it especially unlikely was the music biz megastar that this new band knocked off the perch.

S6: My baby, Abdul, blackly.

S5: Michael Jackson and his blockbuster album, Dangerous, in the three decades since this upset, much has been made of its David and Goliath qualities.

S1: But I rarely hear anyone talk about the holiday factor in Nirvana’s chart feet. There’s a subtle way that Christmas and the more accurate billboard charts of 1991 and 92 made never triumph possible John.

S5: Nancy, what is your word about what you mean? Having more accurate data gave the music business a window into which discs sold best during the holidays.

S1: It even upended old ideas about how late in the year was too late to release a new album. Musicians from the Worlds of Country and Rock took advantage of this information. But by the end of the 90s, the acts taking the most advantage of the new Christmas sales patterns were from the world of rap. By the dawn of the 21st century. The holiday season had effectively been divided into pre Christmas and post Christmas.

S5: There were the albums you bought for others.

S1: And the ones you bought for yourself, been itching to check them out now. And when music went digital in the new millennium post, Christmas not only created improbable hit albums, but some even more improbable hit songs. The December gambit even set the stage for a new way of releasing albums in the digital era, a tactic we now call pulling a Beyonce flawless ladies. Today on hit parade, we will talk about how the holiday season shapes the way we consume music and not just Christmas music. The final weeks of the year have always been important to the recording industry. But while the albums that have wound up under the tree are often fairly predictable, the hits that come out of Christmas are not always so merry.

S5: And that’s where your hit parade marches today, the week Nirvana’s Nevermind first topped the Billboard 200 album chart and its lead single Smells Like Teen Spirit shot into the Hot 100 Top 10. This happened on a chart dated January 11, 1992. But as I’ll explain, that date is a little misleading.

S1: Kurt Cobain’s lyrics about a mulatto, an albino, a mosquito and his libido might not sound like a Christmas carol, but it’s how a generation of teens home for the holidays said, here we are now entertain us. This, of course, is the duo of Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel with Mrs. Robinson, their 1968 number one smash taken from the movie The Graduate, and I’m playing Simon and Garfunkel to illustrate a point about Billboard magazine’s chart dates and the concept that I call the data lag. Bucklin because this is going to get nerdy. If you’re into pop music, you’ve probably looked up the song that was number one the day you were born, and Mrs. Robinson happens to be my best friend’s birthday song. It was on top of the Hot 100 the week that Ed, my buddy from high school, was born. By the way, Merry Christmas, Ed. Liz and I send socially distanced hugs to you and Cedric. Anyway, my pal Ed was born June 13th, 1968, and Mrs. Robinson was the hot 100 number one song for the week ending June 15th, 1968. This, by the way, is what I say at the start of every hit parade when I introduce the episodes key billboard hit quote. That’s where your hit parade marches today, the week ending some date Billboard magazine issue dates are Saturdays and their charts have week ending days following me so far. So here’s why this is a bit misleading and why, if you want to get really technical about it, Mrs. Robinson is not my friend Ed’s Real World Birth Week number one song, as you have probably noticed, if you’ve ever bought a paper magazine on a NEWSSTAND magazine, issues are always dated ahead. For example, the famed September issue of Vogue magazine always hits newsstands and subscriber mailboxes in August. The September issue is folks yearly fashion Bible hits newsstands August 20.

ADVERTISEMENT

S4: Then the same applies to Billboard and issue of Billboard that’s dated June 15th, was actually printed the week before and it would hit newsstands anywhere from five to eight days before the 15th. Moreover, and this is the part that really matters if you’re a chart geek, the data that billboard used to put together, that chart was collected even earlier, like almost three weeks before the issue date printed on the magazine. So what that means for my buddy Ed is in a way, this might be Ed’s birth week.

S7: No. One is song.

S8: Herb Alpert’s This Guy’s In Love With You didn’t go to number one on the hot 100, again, officially going by the chart date until the week ending June 22nd, 1968.

S1: It stayed there the next four weeks through mid-July. Now, June 22nd is more than a week after my friend Ed was born. But the data billboard collected the actual singles sales figures and radio playlist reports that made Herb Alpert number one. Those sales and spins actually happened in the real world around when Ed was born. So on paper at that time, the number one song in the USA was Simon and Garfunkel song. But in reality, when Mrs. Robinson was in its final week of selling the most records and getting the most airplay around late May, Ed was still being carried by his mom. Hi, Eileen. The day Ed came into the world, whatever the billboard chart on NEWSSTAND said, the song that was really dominating the airwaves and the stores on that day was, This guy’s in love with me.

S8: Now, by the way, this is a little too nerdy, even for me, you can drive yourself crazy overthinking this.

S1: When I’m looking up a friend’s birthday number one song, I just go to the billboard issue date for the week they were born. I don’t try to triangulate what song was selling the most and getting the most radio spins the day their mom was giving birth. Also, honestly, as pleasant as that Herb Alpert song is, I’m pretty sure my buddy Ed would rather his birth date be associated with a song as classic as Mrs. Roberts. Also, this technicality doesn’t matter if a song spends months on top of the chart, then on the day you were born, the song was probably number one, both on paper and in the real world. If she’s listening right now, I’d like to reassure my niece, Samantha, who really loves the birth week number one song game, that no matter how you slice it, her birthday song is still Beyonce’s irreplaceable.

S5: Happy birthday, Samantha.

S1: The reason I walked you through all this geeking this was to explain the real world effects of the data lag on Billboard’s charts, the music listening you’re doing right now, whether on the radio, Spotify or a download you just bought from iTunes, it’s getting tracked by Billboard, but it won’t be counted on the hot 100 until the chart dated as much as two weeks from now. So since it’s December, let’s talk about how this data lag skews the chart performance of Christmas music. Last December, I devoted a hit parade episode to one of the most improbable chart feats of all time, how Mariah Carey’s All I Want for Christmas is you finally reached number one on the hot 100, a full 25 years after it was released last holiday season. Carrie’s Christmas Chesnut spent a total of three weeks at number one. It was on top of the hot 100 that was dated December 21st, 2019, December 28th, 2019 and January 4th, 2010. But hang on a minute, that third week, Mariah’s Christmas record was still dominating the airwaves in early January, that seems improbable, right? We all know how Christmas music works. You hear it everywhere through December 25th or 26th. But then within a couple of days, it’s yanked from our car stereos and Spotify playlists and it doesn’t come back until the next November was all I want for Christmas is you really number one, a week and a half after Christmas Day and four days after New Year’s. Well, yes and no, there’s that data lag again for the chart week that was dated January 4th. Billboard collected streaming and sales that actually happened from December 20th through 2006, the peak of Christmas. By the way, radio data collection is on a slightly different weekly cycle from streams and sales.

S4: But airplay wise, Mariah’s big third week also started a couple of days before Christmas. So in the Billboard history books, Mariah was reportedly number one through January 4th. But in reality, she was dominating the airwaves and Spotify only through Boxing Day.

S1: This has happened a lot with Christmas music on the charts, Billboard history shows that Bobby Helms’s 1957 song Jingle Bell Rock peaked at number six, the second week of January 1958. Jingle bells. Jingle bells. Jingle bells. Jingle bells. Jingle Bells and Band AIDS, do they know it’s Christmas? A 1984 release peaked on the Hot 100 at number 13, the third weekend of January 1985. Again, the seminal charity, mega singles, actual airplay and sales were concentrated into the final days of 84 and. So let’s finally go back to 1991, including that year’s holiday season, my long explainer on the billboard data lag helps us understand exactly what happened on the charts that year.

S5: So long. That’s a case number.

S1: Now, a disclaimer. I am a generation expert who was in college in 1991, but I want to convey one main thing about Nirvana’s Nevermind. And this applies whether you worship the album or think it’s overrated. Bands like Nirvana really, truly were not supposed to top the charts in 1991. Three decades later, there’s now a school of critics who think never mind has been so overhyped that its breakthrough was not seminal, not momentous, not that big of a deal. Trust me, it was a big deal, no one from my generation had ever seen a band quite like Nirvana topped the charts. None of the American punk or post punk predecessors that laid the groundwork for Nirvana have had actual chart hits, not black flag down. I tried to go.

S9: Or Husker Du.

S10: Or Sonic Youth.

S1: Or even Boston’s Pixie’s, whose sound Kurt Cobain himself later confessed to ripping off when he wrote Smells like Teen Spirit, no hit for the Pixies either.

S5: Also, at a time when grunge was not yet a genre name or a scene or even a media hype, yet Nirvana were a pretty quirky band, even when they were catchy and they were catchy.

S1: Formed in Aberdeen, Washington, in 1987 by guitarist and vocalist Kurt Cobain and bassist Krist Novoselic, Nirvana were signed to Seattle based independent label Sub Pop in November 1988.

S4: On their 1989 debut album, Bletch, indie rock fans noticed that Nirvana frontman and primary songwriter Cobain had a way with the tune.

S5: Songs like About a Girl had Beatles esque melodies underneath the grungy guitars. Between Nirvana’s first and second albums after a series of drummers came and went, Cobain and Novoselic were joined by Washington, D.C. based drummer Dave Grohl.

S1: It was like Ringo Starr belatedly joining the Beatles. The band’s sound was complete. Grohl gave Nirvana a serious kick. Produced by Butch Vig, a Madison, Wisconsin based sonic craftsman who made recording sound both raw and sleek, Nevermind came out in September 1991 and largely by accident, the stage had been set for Nirvana’s unlikely chart breakthrough. For starters, Seattle based Rock was already starting to break on the charts before Nirvana. Alice in Chains broke over the summer of 1991, their man in the box made the top 20 on Billboard’s album rock chart in July, and by the early fall, fellow Seattle band Soundgarden would issue their third album and eventual breakthrough Bad Motor Finger.

S5: Now, my niece and Pearl Jam, a new band formed out of members from the former mother Love Bone, issued their eventual blockbuster debut, 10.

ADVERTISEMENT

S4: Moreover, 1991 had already produced another unexpected, though long earned chart topper from the world of alternative music, Athens, Georgia band RTM, who had already scored gold and platinum albums in the 80s but never a number one album. They’re Out of Time LP powered by the number four hit Losing My Religion Changed Van.

S1: The pop charts were also starting to reflect the sounds of British rave, indie dance and baggy music, such as the number one smash Unbelievable by UK band M.F.. Yeah, unbelievable. By the fall, even the established multi platinum Irish rockers U2 were adopting Manchester style rave beats on their acclaimed album, Achtung Baby. Still as good of a musical environment as this was for Nirvana to drop their new album, it didn’t hurt that they came packed with an irresistible single one that would prove indelible.

S5: Smells like Teen Spirit, the song Kurt Cobain wrote as a deliberate Pixie’s homage and named after a brand of deodorant aimed at teenagers was not only track one on Nevermind, it was the album’s rallying cry in September 1991.

S1: It sounded different, generationally specific, even catchy. But it didn’t behave like a pop song at first.

S5: The same week, Nevermind landed in record stores and debuted on the Billboard 200 album chart at number 144, smells like Teen Spirit broke into the lower rungs of Billboard’s modern rock chart. That was the only chart it was on for the better part of two months as it climbed into the modern rock top 20 by October, the top five by November, mainstream rock stations began playing it to around the same time, MTV took its iconic video of the band playing an anarchistic thrash high school pep rally and moved it from their late night alternative rock show 120 minutes into daytime power rotation.

S1: This was already somewhat unprecedented.

S11: One at best.

S1: As never mind Rose on the album chart, it was possible to think that all this was just a happy fluke.

S5: The album broke into the Billboard 200 Top 40 in early November, the top 10 just before Thanksgiving. Meanwhile, on the hot 100, smells like Teen Spirit finally cracked the chart by early December. Remarkably, for a band that had never appeared on a pop chart before, it debuted all the way up at number 40, fueled by unusually strong singles sales. Billboard reported by mid-December that the song ranked only seventy third in pop radio airplay, but it was already ranked seventh in singles sales. Music buyers were pushing the song up the Hot 100. If the Nirvana phenomenon had gone no further than this, it still would have been exceptional.

S1: Don’t forget that all of this was happening in 1991, the year the billboard charts had been converted to SoundScan. As we’ve discussed in several hit parade episodes, including last month’s show on Garth Brooks and the 90s chart breakthrough of country music for. SoundScan finally told the music business which albums and singles were truly selling the best, mostly that helped the genres of rap and country chart better.

S4: But SoundScan helped a lot of formerly underrated music get its due in Billboard, a left field rock band like Nirvana with a song as edgy as smells like Teen Spirit, would be accurately captured on the charts, too. Even so, Nirvana’s chart performance in the closing weeks of ninety one was exceptional. Never mind was lodged in the top 10 for all of December nineteen ninety one. But now it was the thick of holiday shopping season and the competition was getting much tougher.

S6: My baby don’t go back on.

S1: In November 1991, just before Thanksgiving, pop superstar Michael Jackson emerged with his first new album of the 90s, the follow up to his 1987 blockbuster Bad, the new disc was called Dangerous, and it was greeted with a level of hype more akin to the Olympics than a pop album.

S4: Jackson’s label Epic, insisted the media refer to him for the first time ever as the King of Pop, and most journalists and fans dutifully obliged. And the whole dangerous campaign kicked off two weeks before the album dropped with the first single and one very expensive video to get on up here.

S1: It is the world premiere of Michael Jackson Black or.

S5: Black or white wasn’t just a video. It was an event in America.

S4: It premiered simultaneously on MTV, VH1, BET and Fox, as well as the BBC s Top of the Pops in the U.K., the global audience for black or white across 27 countries was estimated at 500 million viewers. The clip featured cameos by Macaulay Culkin. George went from NBC’s Cheers and supermodel Tyra Banks in a face swapping CGI sequence featuring the then novel technology called Morphing. And oh yeah, the song. It was pretty infectious.

S5: Black or white, was Michael Jackson’s discourse on racism in the form of a pop song with a brain colonising guitar riff that echoed John Mellencamp Hurts So Good and a middle song rap by producer Bill Bottrell. It was also a chart dominating insurance policy, all but guaranteed to command the hot 100. Sure enough, in just its third week, black or white shot to number one. Maybe the black or white video was not without controversy after the song was over, the video kept going for several more minutes in which an angry Jackson, presumably incensed by racism, smashed a car, zipped his fly and touched himself in the area of his crotch.

S4: The closing segment disturbed enough parents that MTV and other outlets mostly stopped playing the tail end of the clip, and Jackson apologized and issued an edit to the video that CGI in antiracist messages on the car windows. But if, as they say, controversy is good for business, the contrite Jackson made back the Dangerous album debuted on the Billboard 200 chart at number one in early December 1991.

S5: Now, at this point, Nirvana’s Nevermind was still in the top 10 now girls.

S1: But it looked like it had gone about as far as it would go. The album had fallen back to number six, stuck behind not only Jackson’s dangerous, but other heavily hyped fourth quarter albums like rapper Hammer’s Too Legit to quit.

S5: And the mom friendly, growly voice balladeer Michael Bolton.

S1: Going into Christmas week on the official Billboard album chart for the week ending December twenty eighth nineteen ninety one, Jackson, Hammer and Bolton were all in the top five alongside Garth Brooks and U2, all established multi platinum sellers.

S4: Nirvana’s Nevermind was stalled at number six, although the album was now certified Platinum Billboard album chart analyst Jeff Mayfield predicted that after selling more than 300000 copies a week through the entire holiday season, Michael Jackson was poised to dominate the album chart deep into the winter. That’s what made the chart that billboard published just after the New Year.

S5: Such a jolt. Nirvana leapt all the way from number six to number one on the Billboard 200, knocking out Michael Jackson’s dangerous, remember, about a month before Nevermind had fallen back from number four to number six, suggesting that the album had peaked on the chart. What virtually no one was expecting was for Nirvana to reverse course and hurdle to number one.

S4: For the record, not only were chart fans stunned, like your hit parade host who clearly remembers almost dropping the new Billboard magazine at a Tower Records in early January 1992 out of pure shock music biz, insiders were stunned to longtime Billboard chart beat columnist Paul Grine wrote, quote, Nirvana pulls off an astonishing palace coup by dethroning the King of Pop, unquote. The magazine’s album sales analyst, Jeff Mayfield, wrote, quote, Industry ites are still amazed by the feat Nirvana scored, unquote. Mayfield further explained that the album had grown its sales by one hundred and ninety three thousand copies in a week, a record for the then still new SoundScan system at a time on the calendar when most albums coming out of Christmas typically sold fewer copies, not more.

S5: About that calendar, Nirvana took over No one on the billboard issue dated January 11th, 1992. However, as per my earlier explanation of the data lag in Billboard’s charts, the sales used to compile this chart were collected late in the prior year, to be exact, from December twenty third through the 29th, two days before the holiday Christmas itself and the four days afterward. In short, Michael Jackson was the king of the 1991 Christmas buying season. Nirvana were the rulers of post Christmas. And what is post Christmas in the music world, it’s when consumers, mostly teenagers, spend the gift cards they’ve received or maybe exchange a CD or a tape they were given for one they like better. Now, we don’t have data proving conclusively that armies of 1991 teenagers brought their copies of Michael Jackson’s Dangerous Back to Sam Goody and swapped them for Nirvana’s Nevermind. Though it is interesting that this week of massive sales growth for Nevermind, an album with an insolent, punk worthy and now iconic image on its cover of a baby swimming after a dollar on a fishing hook fell mostly between Christmas and New Year’s, when high school and college kids were hanging out at home. What we can say conclusively is more Americans in the closing days of 1991 bought never mind likely for themselves than they did CDs by Michael Jackson or Michael Bolton or Whammer or YouTube.

S4: As I indicated, Nirvanas chart, who was revealed days before January 11th, 1992, the date on the official chart, but on the night of the actual January 11th, that was a busy day for the band.

S5: Ladies and gentlemen, Nirvana. Nirvana made their network TV debut that very night on Saturday Night Live, playing their smash Smells Like Teen Spirit.

S1: That same week, the song had reached its peak of number six on the Hot 100 later in the evening for their second SNL showcase, perhaps to indicate they hadn’t become soft bellied pop hit makers.

S5: The band, with the official number one album in America, performed the Nevermind Deep Cut Territorial. This SNL showcase would return, never mind, to number one on the hot 100, but three weeks later, after its first stint in the top slot, by the way, there’s that data lag again.

S1: Garth Brooks went back to number one for a couple of weeks in between anyway. For the rest of the winter and spring of 1992, Nirvana was lodged in the album charts, top 10 or top 20, and generated further hits like Come as You.

S5: Never mind went quadruple platinum by June. It would eventually be certified diamond for 10 million in sales.

S4: As for Michael Jackson, his dangerous album never returned to no one, although it did generate six more top 40 hits, including the number two hit.

S12: Remember the.

S1: But the truth is, Jackson’s dangerous did just fine. It sold seven million in the U.S. and ranked as the second biggest album of 1992 behind Garth Brooks is Ropin the Wind, but over Nirvana’s Nevermind, which ranked third for the year. Still, the perception of Nirvana’s chart coup was paramount. The idea that an upstart band on only its first major label album could overtake the self-proclaimed King of Pop.

ADVERTISEMENT

S4: It was irresistible to the media. Verbs like pushed, shoved, steamrolled and knocked out were used in headlines to describe what Kurt Cobain’s trio did to Jackson. They made it sound like Nirvana had plotted the attack. But of course, nothing about Nirvana’s coup was planned. Sales expectations were modest. Nirvana’s label, DGC records run by mogul David Geffen, was only hoping Never Mind might sell as well as the last Sonic Youth album, maybe 100000 copies if they were lucky, not millions. The album came out in September and it took more than three months to reach number one. Typically, albums expected to dominate the holiday season come out in October or November. This was a well-established industry practice from the 80s into the early 90s.

S13: Albums as huge and Christmas dominating as Lionel Richie’s can’t slow down.

S10: Bruce Springsteen’s live boxed set.

S14: George Michael’s faith, yes, I got to have.

S5: And Whitney Houston’s bodyguard soundtrack and.

S15: Will always love.

S1: All came out a few weeks before Thanksgiving and crucially ahead of Black Friday, when retailers rang up their strongest sales of the year, releasing an album in that window was a signal to the marketplace. This is a glossy, high quality product that can be wrapped and placed under the tree. But in the SoundScan era, which started the same year, never mind, was released.

S5: The recording industry now had more finely tuned data about when certain albums sold best. So it was now possible to strategically time an album to appeal to people buying music for themselves. Like, never mind.

S1: Maybe it wasn’t so crazy to issue an album deep into December that was more likely to be bought with a gift certificate by an unaccompanied young person, not just a thrashing grunge album but say, a gangsta rap album from South Central.

S12: You think you’re stuck?

S1: So in 1993, former NWA member Ice Cube released his fourth studio album, Lethal Injection, on the unusually late date of December 7th, it sold well, going double platinum and peaking at number five, although that was a bit of a comedown for Cube. His prior album, 1992, The Predator had reached number one, but other rappers kept experimenting with later released dates, including New Jersey rapper Redman, who dropped his third album, Muddy Waters on December 10th, 1996. It peaked at number 12, which was his best chart show to date.

S16: You ready to get this checked out? Whatever, man. You’re ready to start it up.

S1: But experiments like ice cubes and Redmon’s were still the exception. By the mid 90s, the week Redmon’s Muddy Waters debuted at number 12, the chart dated December 28th, 1996, the number one spot was held by no doubts Tragic Kingdom, an album that was months old, which their label, Interscope Records, had been working at radio and retailers all year.

S13: It would take until 1998 and another rising rap star to finally challenge the notion that a top selling album couldn’t come out near the very end of the year because one would be telling you that DMX born Earl Simmons, raised in Yonkers, New York and named after the DMX programmable drum machine, emerged as the new king of hardcore rap in the late 90s after the deaths of Tupac Shakur and the notorious Biggie.

S4: There was buzz on DMX early in the decade. In 1991, the Source magazine promoted him as an unsigned hype, and he spent the mid 90s on the fringes of hip hop, releasing one off singles and dropping bars on mix tapes and tracks by acts like Jay-Z and L.L. Cool J. By the time DMX signed to Def Jam Raps, a dominant label and issued his debut album in May of 1998, he was a seeming overnight sensation who’d actually been in the game for nearly a decade.

ADVERTISEMENT

S1: His barking delivery, inspired by his years befriending stray dogs as a teenager, became his calling card stuff, shutting down. This explains how in the late spring of 98, DMX, his first album, It’s Dark and Hell is Hot, debuted on top of the Billboard album chart, a rarity for a rap newcomer.

S4: And the president of Def Jam decided to challenge DMX to build on that momentum right away. He promised the rapper a million dollar bonus if he could record and release a second album before the end of the year since.

S13: It would be a full studio album with the immediacy of a street mixtape at a time when major rappers would typically go at least a year between albums working with producer Suess Beats, DMX banged out his second album with just a few weeks to spare before the end of the year.

S4: Of course, that meant that he would be issuing the album at the height of the holiday season and running headlong into the most dominant album seller of the decade.

S8: Such a strange combination of a woman and a child, as we discussed in our last hit parade, 1998, was the year country megastar Garth Brooks decided to set some chart records by releasing his first concert album, Double Life.

S4: The two CD set arrived the week of Thanksgiving 1998, and it opened to a million in sales in its first week, the first album to do so. Double Lives settled in atop the chart for all of December, and it looked like it would be unstoppable until well into the New Year. In the midst of Garth’s run on top, Def Jam announced that DMX is second album would be out on December 22nd, just three days before Christmas. And the CD was not terribly Christmassy unless your idea of Christmas is the horror movie Silent Night. Deadly Night. True to DMX Street CRED, the album’s cover photo showed the rapper shirtless and drenched in blood.

ADVERTISEMENT

S13: Its title was Flesh of My Flesh and Blood and My Blood, My Love of My Life. This was essentially unprecedented in the pages of Billboard. Jeff Mayfield reported, quote, Conventional wisdom in the music business held that a title released just days before Christmas might get lost in the shuffle might even have trouble finding its way to store shelves, unquote. Some in the industry also questioned whether it was wise to issue a new DMX album When It’s Dark and Hell is Hot. His debut was still lodged in the top 30. The naysayers were all proved wrong. Flesh of my flesh and Blood of my blood debuted sales of 670000 copies, one of the 10 biggest weeks of the SoundScan era to date. More importantly, DMX is second album codified a new industry practice, the hip hop album Drop, intended for the post Christmas fan. It took Nirvana’s chart topping success from seven years earlier, which again was an accident of timing and turned it into a strategy where gift givers, especially parents, going to gift wrap a CD with a blood drenched DMX on the cover or for that matter, a Nirvana CD with a submerged baby on the cover. Not likely would teens buy it on their own while home for the holidays? Is hell hot? Putting out flesh of my flesh, blood of my blood before Thanksgiving wouldn’t have helped it on the charts. It would have fallen short of Garth Brooks live album. Dropping it nine days from the end of the year was like a dog whistle to young music fans. This CD is for you. Merry Christmas. What about that?

S1: Lie down by Bob. This became a chart trend for roughly the next decade, each year, a few mainstream parent and child friendly albums would dominate the holiday shopping season, stuff like Celine Dion’s 1999 Greatest Hits album All the Way, which sold four million copies by that Christmas. Or a Kenny G holiday album, he put out several, always a couple of weeks before Thanksgiving, and they always went platinum by December. And then with just days left before Christmas, the rap CDs that were guaranteed to make parents run out of the room would arrive and teens and 20 somethings would hit music stores in droves by early January.

ADVERTISEMENT

S5: Given the data lag on Billboard’s charts, these hip hop titles, the top, the billboard chart, lots of.

S1: One year after his successful Christmas Week gambit, DMX returned on December 21st, 1999 with his third album and then there was ex, it knocked Celine Dion from her album chart Perche and became his top seller, packed with his biggest hits, including What’s My Name and of Jovovich Pop Up in Mexico.

S13: Not to be outdone, New King of New York rap Jay-Z released an album even later in 1999.

S4: He dropped his volume Three Life and Times of Carter on December 28, 1999. In early January of 2000, in back to back weeks, first DMX and then Jay took turns on top of the billboard 200 by just.

S1: It will be in the next several years, more rappers and hip hop friendly R and B singers would drop new albums in the last half of December. On December 19th, 2000, Snoop Dogg offered the last meal. It became his best selling CD since his 1993 debut, Doggystyle Snoop. Back on December 18th, 2001, NAS released Still Mattick, a would be sequel to his classic 1994 debut, Illmatic. It became his best seller in about five years.

S17: One swaps, one rapper, one man. What I stand for speaks for itself, fatele, understand and want to see me on top.

S1: A few years later, Queen of hip hop soul Mary J. Blige dropped her CD, The Breakthrough on December 20th, 2005. Notably Blige previous album, 2003’s Love and Life Had Fallen Off and Sales becoming her first disc not to go multi platinum. But the breakthrough returned the queen to her throne, topping the Billboard 200 in January and going double platinum. So.

S18: Nothing can be said, Co. You just can’t be without your pay.

S1: One week after Blighters album arrived on December 27th, 2005, singer and Oscar winner Jamie Fox released Unpredictable, his first new album after a decade focused on his acting. Blige herself was one of Jamie Fox’s guests on the album, along with a half dozen rap superstars, including Common, Kanye West, Snoop Dogg, The Game and Ludacris Make.

S5: The spontaneous Red Foxes unpredictable followed obliges the breakthrough into the number one spot in January 2006, and the two discs traded the Billboard 200 top slot for more than a month.

S4: The post Christmas tactic worked wonders as album sales began to slump in the mid 2000s and the industry began its long, fitful shift from physical to digital music. At first, before streaming services were invented, digital music meant downloads, which were dominated in the aughts and early tens by Apple’s iTunes music store. And here again, Christmas, and especially post Christmas, had an unmistakable impact on the charts, this time the singles charts.

S1: In January 2006, the Hot 100 was overtaken for just one week by a quirky rap track by a group that would never have a major hit again, Laffy Taffy was the handiwork of the Atlanta troop D for L, an acronym for Down for Life. They were progenitors of a micro genre called SNAP Music. It was especially popular for cell phone ringtones and differentials. Hit might be the most uncluttered number one song in Hot 100 history. Oh baby, I know you got your stuff. How exactly did differentials skeletal hit take over the Hot 100 just after Christmas 2005? For one thing, this was the first holiday season where Apple’s iTunes counted for the Hot 100. For another thing, Apple’s iPod was at its peak of gift giving popularity, and a lot of teenagers woke up Christmas morning with a new gadget to fill with songs. And among 99 cent download buyers, Laffy Taffy was a smash giveaway as the shaking goes along with the week after Christmas 2005, from December 26th through January 1st, Laffy Taffy sold one hundred and seventy five thousand dollar downloads, a record at the time. The previous record, set by Kanye West’s 2005 hit Golddigger, was only 81000 downloads differential in a single week doubled that total. In essence, this was DMX Post Christmas business model shifting to cyberspace and to the singles chart. Songs that people over 25 had little interest in were snapped up by young people filling their new iPods and cashing in their iTunes gift cards for the next half dozen Christmases. As the iTunes store kept growing in popularity, download sales the week after the holiday kept setting sales records. Just after Christmas 2007, Sunshine State rapper Flo Rida sold 467 thousand dollar downloads of his smash with Tapin Lo, the song that, as my stepdaughter knows, is all about apple bottom jeans and boots with the fur. Post Christmas 2009, new pop star and kind of rapper Kesha saw her debut single Tick Tock surged to number one after selling 610000 downloads in a single week, down several flights seen. And in 2011, EDM pop rap duo L.M. Feto sold 820000 downloads in two weeks just before and just after Christmas of their goofball hit Sexy and I know it, pushing that song to number one. I’m sexy and I know.

S4: It’s good that the music business was selling so many downloads in the late aughts and early tens because albums were off massively, the dynamics on the Billboard 200 album chart had shifted. Now that teenagers were gravitating towards single downloads, the albums that sold best tended to skew older. During this period, Christmas albums did especially well, whether they were by Josh Groban, whose 2007 seasonal CD, Noel became the year’s top seller in the final weeks of the year, selling four million copies in just two months.

S1: Or reality TV discovery, Susan Boyle, Simon Cowell’s prodigy from The X Factor, she scored back to back number one albums in two consecutive holiday seasons in 2009 and 2010.

S5: We would never tell what this meant was that the DMX Post Christmas model for rap albums was starting to wane.

S4: In 2011, Trap kingpin Jay-Z released his latest album, Thug Motivation 103 Hustlers Ambition on December 20th. But it only managed a number three debut, his first major label album, not to debut at either number one or number two.

S1: And why did Jersey fall short, because the Billboard 200 that Christmas was dominated by the Michael Bublé Christmas album, its sales that week were roughly double Jeezy’s album.

S19: It’s beginning to look a lot like Christmas. Everywhere you go.

S1: The 2010s, we’re going to need a new business model for albums aimed at young people as pop, rap and R and B fans were all migrating to the digital realm, cutting edge megastars would need a way to generate the kind of excitement that a Christmas week album drop used to inspire at the peak of DMX and Jay-Z. And the person who pulled it off happened to be Jay Z’s wife. In an album released that is now considered legendary, Beyonce issued her fifth solo studio album, the self-titled Beyonce sang as an iTunes exclusive on December 13th, 2013, with no warning whatsoever. It was, if you will, a proof of concept that an album in the digital era didn’t need weeks of prerelease hype or even a physical CD release. Mind you, the surprise digital album was not a totally new idea. Back in 2007, cutting edge British rock band Radiohead, who had just completed a major label contract, Self, released their seventh studio album, In Rainbows, exclusively online with only days of advance notice.

S5: The move delighted radio heads rabid fans who were invited to pay whatever they wanted for the digital album before it later went on sale as a traditional CD and vinyl LP six years later.

S1: What made Beyonce’s move pathbreaking was her surprise album was a total surprise. The project was kept completely secret for months by bees team of writers, producers, musicians and even video directors. The Beyonce album was sold with a glossy music video for each track. Forget Radio Heads Days of advance notice. The Beyonce album was issued with minutes of advance notice to to disclose to me, and it was a blockbuster. B dropped the album on a Thursday, which at the time was in the middle of Billboard’s chart week, seemingly a handicap. It didn’t matter.

S4: Beyonce sold 600 and 17000 copies in the U.S. in just three days as an iTunes exclusive, making it an easy number one on the album chart out selling discs that had been on sale all week right through the holiday season. Beyonce kept selling, even though it was only available digitally in its three weeks. At number one, the album sold one point three million copies that buyers couldn’t even wrap and put under the tree. Like Nirvana’s album in 1991 or DMX is in 1998.

S13: Beyonce’s album was a Christmas gift. Fans gave themselves six in the morning.

S12: My fifth week on.

S1: By February, Drunk in Love, the lead single from Beyonce with rap support from her husband, Jay-Z, reached number two on the Hot 100 returning queen bee to the charts, top five for the first time in four years. The surprise album gambit had not only restored Beyonce to her place atop Pops Mount Olympus, it redefined the headline grabbing album release for the digital generation.

S4: In the year since 2013, dropping a surprise digital album has been called Colloquially. Pulling a Beyonce queen bee herself has followed the template several times, dropping surprised projects like her 2016 masterpiece Lemonade. It, too, arrived with no advance warning, launching exclusively on the streaming service title and as a mini movie on HBO.

S20: They don’t love you like I love you. Slow down. They don’t love you like I love you back.

S1: Unlike the Beyonce album, lemonade was not issued around the holidays. Be dropped it in late April 2016. In fact, numerous superstars have followed Beyonce, along with surprise digital albums all over the calendar, from Drake to Eminem to J. Cole to Childish Gambino. Following B’s template most closely was neo soul singer D’Angelo, who surprised released his long awaited comeback album Black Messiah on December 15th, 2014, one year after Beyonce.

S21: And oh.

S1: So as late as last year, hip hop acts were still scoring number one albums by issuing them in the DMX style December window on December 21st, 2013. Rapper 21 Savage released his album I Am Greater Than I Was, and it was on top of the album chart by early January 2019.

S16: How many times did you realize how many more than died? How many times did you cheat and how many times did you lie?

S1: It’s funny to consider that all of these holiday related release tactics started with a fortuitous week of sales 29 years ago by a fledgling grunge band.

S16: And Nirvana didn’t even have to record a Christmas song to change the game or do a verse of the song like We wish you a Merry Christmas. We wish you a Merry Christmas.

S1: By the way, that’s Kurt Cobain, Krist Novoselic and Dave Grohl with the only recorded evidence while Cobain was still alive of the trio singing a Christmas song. They were shooting a promo for of all people Rupal for his early 90s TV talk show. Maybe Nirvana never released a Christmas song. It wouldn’t have been their style, not even ironically, but Taylor Swift certainly has since she broke a decade and a half ago. Swift has recorded several holiday songs for various compilations, none of them a big hit.

S20: But for me it’s just one detail time. Because they were Christmas’s when you.

S1: Why do I bring up Taylor Swift in December 20 20, because she’s pulled a Beyonce twice this year and her very latest album is a Christmas surprise in the space of just five months. While the world was on lockdown during the covid-19 pandemic, Swift recorded two surprise albums, a totally unprecedented move for an artist who previously recorded on a fairly regimented every two years album schedule and pre promoted her releases for weeks or even months.

S8: That all changed in 2020, first with Taylor’s acclaimed August release Folklore. And literally, while we were preparing this hit parade episode, Swift dropped the immediate folklore follow up ever more.

S1: It even includes a more mature Taylor holiday song, the wintry, brooding and contemplative.

S8: Tis the damn season. Not taking notes when this new album approach is really working for Taylor, Folklore spent eight weeks at number one in the summer and fall this year, the longest any of her albums has spent on top in more than five years and ever more is widely expected to be atop the charts the week of Christmas and likely deep into January, as Taylor Swift and frankly, all of us settle our brains for a long winter’s nap, curling up with our music to get us through lockdown. Let’s raise a glass to Taylor and Beyonce singing Nirvana and even DMX. This year especially, it’s good to know our musical favorites can still surprise us. Oh, my goodness. To me, the longest book I’ve ever known, I hope you enjoyed this episode of Hit Parade. Our show was written, edited and narrated by Chris Melaniphy. That’s me. My producer is Benjamin Frisch.
