Speaker A: Rihanna Good girl Going back Take Action.

Speaker B: Welcome to Hit Parade, a podcast of pop chart history from Slate Magazine about the hits from coast to coast. I’Chris Melanhy, Chart Analyst, pop critic and writer of Slates’w this song has one series on today’s show 18 years ago this month, in April 2007, this song debuted on Billboards Hot 100 on its way to a seven week summer run at number one. Rihannas Umbrella, the infectious banger featuring an opening rap by her boss and mentor Jay Z and a chorus hook thats Moto Bella Ella Ella wasnt Rihannas first chart topper. It most certainly would not be her last, but it was the hit that affirmed her superstardom. Its still one of the first songs, if not the song people think of when they hear Rihanna’name when it hit, Rihanna was still a teenager.

Speaker A: Under now.

Speaker B: Lets flash forward exactly a decade from the spring of 2007 to the spring of 2017 when this single peaked on the charts. This is Love on the Brain, the last single from the final album Rihanna released. So far it peaked at number five on the Hot 100, Rihannas 22nd top five hit. Thats one of the highest totals ever by the way. Little did we know that spring week eight years ago that Rihanna was about to take an epic break.

Speaker A: No matter what I do I no good without you and I cant get enough Must be love on the right.

Speaker B: Im speaking to you in the spring of 2025 and Rihanna still hasnt released another album. The latest rumors say shes about to drop an LP and go on a massive world tour, but ill believe that when I hear it. Rumors like this even from RI herself have come and gone in years past. For most of the last decade, the biggest pop star Barbados ever produced has put a stop to the music and thats pretty bizarre. Its crazy that Rihanna is now famous for not releasing music. At the height of her dominance, she was the most prolific artist on the charts issuing an album a year at a time when no other major pop star kept up that punishing schedule she put in the work. Rihanna even alternated her own chart topping smashes with featured performance performances in which she was as big as or bigger than the so called lead artists. In many ways, Rihanna reflected her moment, an era when a new breed of digital pop queens were flooding the zone with danceable downloadable bangers. But as I will explain, Rihana was also something of a throwback to an era where pop stars were expected to stay ahead of the zeitgeist by keeping the product flowing. Year in and year out Baby my.

Speaker A: Bab love I y I need you but all you do is treat me.

Speaker B: Back which might help explain why Rihanna was ready to slow down after flooding the zone for a dozen furiously productive years.

Speaker A: Place.

Speaker B: We Love Today on Hit Parade, we will break down the career of the artist with the most number ones in the 21st century. Thats right, more than Taylor or Drake or Beyon or Gaga or Ariana or Bruno or Justin. A woman who racked up a stunning array of hits before hanging it up. Even if Rihanna never records again, she is already enshrined in the all time Billboard pantheon. And that run of chart toppers kicked off with a banger that was already a throwback to prior eras of pop. And thats where your hit parade marches today, the week ending May 13, 2006, when so s became Rihannas first number one on billboards Hot 100. TheRed be another dozen number ones from her over the next decade. But the key to Sos, besides its music and lyrics, which called back to both the 80s and the 60s, was.

Speaker C: How fast Rihanna dropped it after her career launched.

Speaker B: How did the Barbadian pop goddess use productivity to her advantage? How did she replicate the hit making pace of prior legends like the Beatles, the Supremes, Stevie Wonder or Elton John? Join us as we celebrate one of the most unique, eclectic and amazing runs of the new millennium. Is 2025 getting you down? No need to put out an so’s were bringing back Rihanna and finding hits in a hopeless place. I want to talk for a bit about hitmakers and albums, specifically the pace at which albums are released. Singles are how hitmakers become hitmakers, the songs that scale the Hot 100. But albums are how hitmakers organize their songs into what the kids now call eras. Hello girlsloce, this is Yaya from the most recent LP by Beon, Cowboy Carter, which arrived a little over a year ago, topped the Billboard 200 album chart, went on to win the Grammy for album of the year finally and generated a flotilla of Hot 100 hits including Texas Holdem, 16 Carriages and 2 Most Wanted. Im playing Yaya in particular because its my favorite track on the album.

Speaker A: She up vi he for sensation ladies.

Speaker B: Yeah hey shaking now heres an interesting fact about the Cowboy Carter album. Not counting soundtracks, EPs, compilations or anything she did with Destinys Child or her husband Jay Z, Cowboy Carter is just the eighth studio album by Beon, whos been recording solo for more than two decades. Her solo debut Dangerously in Love came out way back in 2003. Now since Beyon has often been compared to Rihanna, sometimes unfairly, and well get to that. Heres another interesting you know what else is an 8th album anti by Rihanna, except that LP Rihannas last to date came out in 2016, which was only her 12th year as a recording artist. For those keeping score, Rihanna started recording a couple of years after Beyon isn’just.

Speaker A: A Crazy Game My Heartembers when and.

Speaker B: Reached her eighth album just over a decade later. In other words, it took Rihanna about half as long to release eight studio LPs as it took beonce. Now it must be said the outlier in this equation isnt queen B Beyon recording pace is quite normal for a superstar of her stature in the 21st century. Barring one unusually long gap between 2016’lemonade and 2022’s renaissance, Beyon has generated a new studio album roughly every two to three years.

Speaker A: We be making loving one I trying.

Speaker B: Make but Rihannas furious pace from thousand five through 2016, roughly a new LP per year has no modern parallel. Really. To find something comparable you have to go back to the 60s when superstar acts would drop a new LP every few months, often as many as two to three studio LPs per year. The Supremes, for example, their 1965 LP I Hear a Symphony was their eighth LP, and it arrived just a little over three years into their Motown recording career. Eight LPs in three years? I mean imagine that. With that productivity and the Motown machine behind them, The Supremes amassed 12/1 hits on the Hot 100 in just over five years. Rihannas batting average was similarly stunning between 2006 and 2016, just under a decade. Rei scored 14/1 on the Hot 100 in that period. As of this podcast episode. Thats the fourth biggest total in Billboard chart history. Rihanna is behind only three legends. Elvis Presley, who scored 17, has ones between 1956 and 69. Mariah Carey, who amassed 19 number ones from 1990 through 2019.

Speaker A: You can me you’always be my bab.

Speaker B: And the Beatles, who put up a record 20 number ones between 1964 and 1970.

Speaker A: Right now over me.

Speaker B: Rihanna was only 28 years old when she scored her 14th number one 26teens work. Which put her only three away from Elvis and a half dozen away from the Beatles.

Speaker A: Wake up ands wrong. Just get ready. Work work work work work work.

Speaker B: Surely 28 is awfully young for a pop star to retire, but theres a chance RI will never add to that total again. Is it possible? And this is just my own pet theory that Rihannas seemingly early retirement is a function of her higher than usual output in her early career. To help us understand how unusual Rihannas release pattern and hit making was, I want to walk back briefly through chart history and consider prior release patterns of major hit at if everybody had an.

Speaker A: Oan across the USA, then everybodf In.

Speaker B: 1963, the Beach Boys released three albums, Surfin USA, Surfer Girl and Little Deuce Coupe. Each was named after a current hit, and after peaking in the top 10 on the Billboard LP chart, each album would be swiftly supplanted by the next one.

Speaker C: The Beach Boys productivity in their early.

Speaker B: Years was exceptional, but it wasnt far from the norm. Most hit ats in the first decade of Rock and Soul would drop at least two LPs a year. From rock gods like Elvis Presley to teen idols like Brendol Lee to Motown acts like the Miracles. The Smokey Robinson led group issued four albums in 1963 alone, two studio LPs, a live album and even a Miracles Christmas album. The Beatles too were releasing multiple albums per year to each in 1963, 64 and 65. But after the success of their more ambitiously psychedelic LPs, Revolver in 1966 and Sgt. Peppers s Lonely Hearts Club Band in 1967, the Fab Four showed that Major rock acts could take their time between studio LPs. Not counting the Stopgap 67 soundtrack to Magical Mystery Tour, the Beatles went 18 months between Sgt. Pepper and 1960 eights the White Album. Like so many things the group did, this became an accepted, widely adopted concept in the music industry. The album as eventir de.

Speaker C: Take these.

Speaker A: Broken Wings and Learn to Fly.

Speaker B: By the early 70s, it was still expected that groups aimed at young fans would churn out albums quickly, at least once a year or faster. For example, in their first year signed to Motown, the Jackson 5 banged out three studio LP’and a Christmas album. As late as 1973, the Jacksons were still putting out two LPs a year and some superstars were just exceptionally prolific. Carol King dropped two albums of new material in 1971 alone, the classic Tapestry and its less heralded but huge selling follow up music. And for most of his 70s imperial phase, Elton John was putting out two smash LPS’s a year. But by the late 70s, superstars were taking the late Beatles model and supersizing it. Stevie Wonder had been furiously prolific through the early 70s, dropping at least one and sometimes two LPs per year. But after his 1974 smash fulfillingness first.

Speaker C: Finale, Wonder elected to take two years.

Speaker B: To produce a follow up and the media and his label Motown regarded that gap as egregiously long. Motown spent most of that two years pestering Wonder for the album, convinced he was squandering his fanbase. Of course the wait was worth it when Stevie emerged in 1976 with his multi disc master work songs in the Key of life. After Stevie’s songs the gaps between superstar LPs grew longer. Fleetwood Max Rumors Follow Up Tusk took more than two years. The Eagles Hotel California’successor the Long Run took three as did Led Zeppelins final studio LP before their breakup in through the outdoor first.

Speaker A: Im.

Speaker B: So the industry adjusted to the era of the long awaited lp as we discussed in our Great War against the.

Speaker C: Single episode of Hit parade.

Speaker B: By the 80s the labels grew adept at milking hit albums for multiple hit singles. Michael Jackson pioneered the singles Deep album first with his off the wall which in 1980 became the first LP by a soloist to generate four top 10 hits and then Thriller which generated seven top 10 hits over nearly two years from late 1982 through early 84.

Speaker A: Noance.

Speaker B: This meant that follow up albums which were now expected to generate four, five or even seven hits took years for star acts to record and their labels to promote. Not just rock acts but also pop and R and B stars were now expected to have gaps between album eras. Jackson took five years to follow Thriller with Bad, Madonna took two to three between her studio LPs in the 80s. Even Michaels sister Janet Jackson went three years between her 1986 breakthrough Control and its 1989 follow up Rhythm Nation. By the 90s, the blockbuster era of the compact disc album releases grew even more sporadic for artists at all levels of the hit parade. Whether a disc produced piles of hit songs like blockbuster CDS from Mariah Carey, Cheryl Crow, Boys to Men or Alanis Morissette.

Speaker A: It’s like Ray I what name s A Free Ride?

Speaker B: Or just one or two hits like albums from the Cranberries or the Goo.

Speaker C: Goo Dolls.

Speaker B: Multi year gaps between albums became commonplace for megastars and mid tier bands alike. Promotion for a new CD took longer to set up and individual singles were worked to radio for longer periods. For certain hit acts, gaps of three or more years were becoming commonplace. For example, TLC took more than four years to follow up 1990 fours Crazy Sexy Cool with early 90 Nines fan mail. By the early 2000s the two year gap between albums had been entrenched. Nickelback, Nellie, Avril Lavigne or the White Stripes no matter the genre. New albums from your favorite recording artist were expected no sooner than biennially.

Speaker C: It was into this highly regimented millennial recording industry that an aspiring and ambitious teen recording artist born Robin Fenty in Barbados who would become better known under her middle name Rihanna made her debut. Rihannas whole career would upend a lot of received wisdom about hit making metabolism in the 21st century. But first Rihanna had to prove she was more than just the latest tropical fad from a Caribbean island. This infectious hand clapping beet is known as the Diwali Rhym, a track pioneered in Jamaica that by the early 2000s had spread to a slew of recordings in the danceable reggae derived genre known as dance halall. You may not realize it but if you were listening to American pop radio in the early aughts, theres a pretty good chance you heard a hit built out of the Diwali Rhythm. Several such singles crossed over here in 2003, including Sean Paul’s number one smash Get Busy, a Diwali remix of Lumides top 10 R&B jam Never leave you uh oh uh oh.

Speaker A: Hon.

Speaker C: And Wayne Wonders swirling love ballad no letting go. Now here’s one more American hit built out of the Diwali Rhythm. Only this one was released in 2005, two years after the Jamaican beat had supposedly peaked. Pan de Replay was Rihanna’first single. I’ll talk about its chart performance in a moment. By the time it arrived, Rihanna had experienced a whirlwind entree into the American major label system after she was discovered in Barbados by two men who’d once been hitmakers themselves.

Speaker A: There’no way that I can win Thesi.

Speaker C: Evan Rogers and Carl Steurkin were members of a short lived early 90s white funk boy band called Rhythm Syndicate. In 1991 they scored a number two hit on the Hot 100 called Pa A SS N. After Rhythm Syndicate broke up, Rogers and Steurkein stayed in the music business, forming their own syndicated rhythm production company to produce and write songs for other pop acts. While vacationing In Barbados in 2003, Rogers and Sterkein were introduced to a teen singing trio who called themselves Contrast. The ladies didnt have much potential as a girl group, but One of the three, a 15 year old named Robin Fenty, stood out from the moment she entered a room. This by the way is the 15 year old Fenty singing a Mariah Carey song at a Barbados talent competition. Young Robin had had a rough childhood. Her father was addicted to both alcohol and crack cocaine and he abused her mother. The stress may have contributed to a series of chronic migraines. Young Robin suffered through age 14. Only after her parents divorced and she began singing with her girlfriends did her headaches subside. To this day, all who tell the origin story of Rihanna say that from a very young age she burned with star quality. According to John Seabrooks book the Song Machine, when Evan Rogers asked the girl if she was ready for the harsh realities of the music business, Robin Fenty replied without hesitation, it’s all I’ve ever wanted to do. So Rogers and Steurkin signed 15 year old Robin Fenty to a management contract, convinced Robin to switch to her middle name, brought the rehristened Rihanna to America to record demos and began shepherding her to the offices of major label executives. They tried her on a variety of styles. Heres a small snippet of teen Rihanna on a demo trying to replicate Whitney Houstons cover of the Isley Brothers for the love of you.

Speaker A: Day will.

Speaker C: They also wrote her an original song, the Latin flavored R and B ballad the Last Time, which did wind up making Rihannas debut album but would not.

Speaker A: Be the single it’the last time you’re ever gonna kiss these Le Deceive.

Speaker C: What finally did get Rihanna signed was Pon de Replay, a pop flavored dance hall tune featuring a bit of the aforementioned Diwali rhym. Written by outside songwriters and completed by Steurkein and Rogers. It made Rihanna legible to American label executives who could understand how re would fit into the mid augts musical landscape. Part Caribbean, part pop. Among the execs who heard Pond de Replay was rapper Jay Z, who had paused his recording career to serve as the president of Def Jam Records, the storied rap label that was now part of the Universal Music Group conglomerate. Jay was so impressed not only with Pawn de Replay, but more importantly with the determined and steely eyed Rihanna that he insisted she not leave the building without signing to defjam. She would turn out to be the most successful signee during J Zs brief tenure as a record label mogul.

Speaker A: Everybody in the club me a run you ready to move time for your mindset I’m ready for it, let me show.

Speaker C: At first, everyone’s instincts about Rihanna paid off. Released in the spring of 2005, Pan de Replay scaled the Hot 100, reaching number two by July 2005, fulfilling its destiny as an ideal summer hit. Her debut album, Music of the sun dropped in August and cracked the top 10. But like Lumidie or Wayne Wonder before her acts who scored dance halall flavored hits but couldnt follow them up. Rihanna looked like she might be a one hit wonder when her reggae flavored follow up single if its lovin that you want barely scraped the top 40 reaching number 36.

Speaker B: This was when team Rihanna made a.

Speaker C: Pivotal decision that would reverberate through the rest of her career. Rather than try to resuscitate Music of the sun with further singles, they sent Rihanna right back into the studio to record a follow up album. It was the old Motown model on steroids. Defjam Evan Rogers and Carl Steurkin threw even more songwriters and producers at Rihanna’s follow up disc A Girl Like Me which would arrive in April 2006 just eight months after music of the sun and they cast a wider sonic net. Rihanna would not be limited to Caribbean flavored jams. They were going to make her a straight up pop star.

Speaker A: Help me Help.

Speaker C: So s the song that would take Rihanna to the top of the Hot 100 was designed to delight pop fans of several generations. The lyrics by songwriters and music biz journeymen J R Rotam and Evan Kidd Bogart quoted Several well known 80s pop hits like AHAs Take on Me, Cutting crews, I just died in your arms and modern englishes I melt with you. But its most prominent illusion was its sample. Rotam and Bogart built the song out of Tainted love.

Speaker B: Taind love tain weve.

Speaker C: Talked about Soft sells Smash a one.

Speaker B: Hit wonder in America several times on Hit Parade.

Speaker C: To recap, Soft Cells Techno pop jam is itself a remake of a 1965 Northern Soul classic by Gloria Jones Take not Ty Love. Softcel turned Tainted love into synth pop and Got it to number eight on the Hot 100 in 1982.

Speaker A: Toss and turn I can’t sleep at night once I.

Speaker C: That version formed the backbone of Rihanna’s Sos. Not only was Soft Cells recording sampled, the line I toss and turn I can’t sleep at night was woven into so’s pre chorus. The song was a nostalgia bomb.

Speaker A: Time.

Speaker C: Please someonecue me however synthetic and slick so’s affirmed Rihanna could not be pigeonholed. Some of Rihannas handlers worried that the song would diminish rh so called urban cred. But according to Song Machine author John Seabrook, label chief La Reed Jay Zs boss told them forget all that shes like Madonna shes an international pop star. Lets make people dance. So s danced to number one in May of 2006 and stayed there three weeks to further establish that Rihanna had the breath of a cross cultural pop star. For the follow up from A Girl Like Me, Def Jam put out a ballad Unfaithful. Critics carped that the song showed the limits of Rihannas still young voice. She was not yet 18 when she recorded it, but it still reached number six.

Speaker A: I don’tnna do this anymore I don’t wanna be the reason why Every time I walk at the door I see him dying a little more inside After.

Speaker C: A couple more lower charting singles, Rihanna was ready to record another album again. Barely a year after its predecessor. She and her producers had successfully established Rihanna as eclectic, but that also made her elusive, not yet established in the publics mind, as much more than a conduit for hit singles, Rihanna needed a hit that gave her a Persona. Fortunately, a trio of producers led by songwriter Terus the Dream Nash had just the song, a demo they had originally wanted to give to Britneys Spears.

Speaker B: Told you Fore this is the dream singing.

Speaker C: Umbrella, the song that he, Tricky Steuart and Cuck Harl built out of a drum sample from Apples Free Mac Software Garageband. What they did with that beat was fairly ingenious. The track had hip hop swagger paired with pop sweetness, topped off by some nonsensical but irresistible vocal gibberish on the chorus. When Britney Spears team rejected the demo of the song for Britneys 2007 album Blackout, they said they already had enough material. The dream team passed it to La Reed at defjam, who passed it to Rihanna. It was she who heard the songs potential both in its romantic, steadfast lyrics and that crazy hook. I was like this is interesting. This is weird, rihanna recalled in a later interview. But the song kept getting better. I listened to it over and over, she told Reed. I need this record. I want to record it tomorrow. For the crowning touch, Rihannas mentor and label boss Jay Z, who was pivoting out of the executive suite back to his recording career, threw in an opening rap that grounded the otherwise romantic song in the streets. It served as a fanfare for a newly minted pop queen.

Speaker A: Anticipation forcation Stack chips with a rainy day J Rainman is back with Little.

Speaker C: Miss Sunshine Hon where you heart Umbrella made Rihanna. It fused with her steely Persona. The lyrics were warm, but she was cool, frosty, regal. She kept the Caribbean lilt in her vocal, but the song was not tropical. It was rather a bespoke blend of enrapturing R and B, blustering hip hop and shimmering pop. Even the video, which went on to win video of the year at the 2007 MT TV Video Music Awards became indelible, a sparkly fantasia of dancers doing umbrella choreography in storms of both water and sparks, and Rihanna at the center of it all. In ballet shoes, body paint and a new angular haircut, she looked like the worlds most alluring cyborg. Rain raining it rain Raining Umbrella not only spent seven weeks at number one on the Hot 100 in June and July, easily winning the crown as 2007s song of the summer. It also led off Rihannas third album Good Girl Gone Bad, her top selling and most hit packed album peaking at number two on the Billboard 200 album chart. Good Girl gone bad in its first year spun off three more hits after Umbrella, the rock inflected Shut up and drive, a number 15 hit, a percolating acoustic ballad duet with singer songwriter Neio hate that I love you, a number seven hit and Dont Stop the Music, a club ban ha built out of a sample of Michael Jacksons wannabe Startin Something, which returned Rihanna to the top three. What also set apart Good Girl Gone Bad was its Deluxe Edition, which prolonged the albums shelf life into a second year, a rarity in the Rihanna catalog. In a way though, this was yet another example of Rihanna treating albums as fungible commodities. Her career, especially in the early years, was driven by singles. At least once a year, Team RE was determined to bring new hits. Good Girl Gone Bad Reloaded arrived in early June 2008, one year after the original version of the album, with three new songs tacked on, such as her duet with the pop rock band Maroon. Although it was not the first album to be rebooted in Special Edition form, previous CDS by Usher and Shakira had been similarly reissued. Good Girl Gone Bad Reloaded did unprecedentedly well. It vaulted Rihannas original album back into the top 10 for the first time in a year and it produced two number one hits, an unheard of hit making ratio for a Special Edition album reboot. Arguably, Good Girl Gone Bad Reloaded raised the bar for Special Edition albums with an EP’s worth of new material tacked on, a tactic, by the way, that many artists still pursue today in the streaming era. In the years immediately after Rihanna’s reboot, this approach would be replicated by album EP Special Edition reissues from Lady Gaga.

Speaker B: And Katy Perry.

ADVERTISEMENT

Speaker C: This is the part as For Rihanna in 2008, the first of her two reloaded singles was a contemptuous ballad that led off with the withering lyric, you look so dumb right now. But it only made Rihanna look smarter.

Speaker A: So standing outside my house.

Speaker C: Take a bow, a dressing down of a faithless soon to be ex written by NYO and Norwegian production team Stargate, who’d produced several of her prior hits, showed how far Rihanna had come as a vocalist in just a couple of years. Two years after Unfaithful, a ballad that received mixed reviews and was not embraced beyond pop radio critics and R and B fans praised Take A Bow, which showed that RI could deliver a potent, soulful vocal worthy of her chart competitor. Beonce Take A Bow became Rihannas first hit to top Billboards R and B charts in addition to topping the Hot 100.

Speaker A: That was quite a show, very entertaining.

Speaker C: But’Bur now for the follow up, Rihanna deployed her most high concept song, an electrop pop track with goth overtones called Disturbia, A haunted house bop that feels descended from Michael Jackson’s Thriller, Disturbia was a completely different sound, look and feel for Rihanna, with a bouncing bum bum be dum melody over creepy sound effects and a keenning chorus hook. Three months after Take A Bow hit has one, Disturbia brought Rihanna right back to the top spot. Just as Good Girl Gone Bad was certified double platinum, it was eventually certified for sales and streams of 7 million copies. Disturbia may have been about as scary as a PG13 horror movie, but one genuinely ominous footnote is who wrote the song R and B pop sensation Chris Brown, who was then Rihannas boyfriend and was riding high with hits of his own. About six months after Disturbia gave Rihanna her fourth career #1 a disturbing altercation between her and Brown just before the 2009 Grammy Awards would change both of their trajectories, and it would give Rihanna, whose story to date seemed to encompass one leveling up success after another, a new form of adversity to overcome, one much darker than the lyrics to any of her hits. When we come back, Rihanna refuses to play the victim and keeps right on working, generating hits and evolving and expanding her sound. The second half of her furious decade of chart domination will be even more prolific than her first, but her greatest challenge, an album statement that would define her artistry, was still to come.
