Speaker A: Barbara Streisand welcome to Hit Parade, a podcast of pop chart history from Slate magazine about the hits from coast to coast. I’m Chris Malanfi, chart analyst, pop critic and writer of Slate’s why is this song number one series on today’s show? Back in 2010, this disco house single by a canadian american duo who called themselves duck Sauce reached the top of Billboard’s club songs chart. The song’s title was taken from its only intelligible lyrics. Besides a series of woos, those lyrics comprised just two words. Barbara Streisand Barbara Streisand the word iconic gets thrown around a lot in popular culture, but you truly are an icon when a chart topping hit is not only named after you, it refers to only you. By the way, the actual Barbara Streisand later said she was, quote, flattered by the club song bearing her name. And why not? 31 years earlier to the week, Streisand herself topped the club chart, then called the disco chart as well as the Hot 100 with her Donna Summer duet no more tears. Enough is enough.

Speaker B: Is enough I can’t go on.

Speaker A: What’S more, at the turn of the life, Barbara Streisand was doing fine on the charts herself. The year before Duck Sauce’s hit, she’d topped the Billboard 200 album chart with her 9th number one album in an upset over Mariah Carey in the wee.

Speaker B: Small hours of the morning. That’s the time you miss him most.

Speaker A: When she scored that chart topping CD in late 2009, Streisand became the only artist to score a number one album in five decades. Barbara was topping the charts as far back as the 60s, in the midst of the british invasion and Motown G.

Speaker B: It’s all fine and damned.

Speaker A: By the 70s, Streisand was scoring chart topping singles to go with her blockbuster lps. She was simultaneously one of the biggest movie stars and pop stars in America.

Speaker B: And you don’t bring me flowers anymore.

Speaker A: Indeed, that was what made Streisand unusual. She built her stage, screen and pop chart fame all at the same time. Her film and Broadway fame boosted her hits from the 60s.

Speaker B: If someone takes a spill, it’s me and not you. Who told you you’re allowed to rain on my parade?

Speaker A: I’ll march my band through the beyond.

Speaker B: Someday I was.

Speaker A: When she worked with contemporary hit makers, she proved adaptable from disco auteurs.

Speaker B: I am a woman in love and I do anything to get you into.

Speaker A: My world and hold you two husky rock stars.

Speaker B: Someone to share my life.

Speaker A: I finally found the world and a half century before our current crop of self powered female performers were asserting themselves as young women and setting chart records, Streisand was doing the same. Starting in her teens and early 20s. Some of those chart records by women performers previously belonged to her. Today on hit parade, we will take on the Voice, aka Barbara Joan, aka Babs. As Barbara, Streisand cycles back into public consciousness thanks to her long awaited, recently published and best selling memoir. This time, the Streisand effect is she wants us to pay attention. We consider her estimable chart feats and ask, is this overanalyzed, much loved and much hated celebrity now maybe a little underrated? After all, 50 years ago this very week, Streisand was topping the charts with a single that swept through popular culture like a colossus. Lest we forget our misty watercolored memories.

Speaker B: Misty watercolor memories of the way we were.

Speaker A: And that’s where your hit parade marches today, the week ending February 2, 174, when the way we were reached number one on Billboard’s Hot 100, Barbara Streisand’s first pop chart topper, but certainly not her last. The song from the smash movie of the same name, pairing her with actor Robert Redford, affirmed Streisand as the 70s queen of all media and a legitimate pop star more than a decade after she broke on Broadway. How did Babs use those golden pipes of hers to bring old school showbiz into the era of rock, funk, soul and disco? How did she keep scoring pop hits through the end of the 20th century and platinum albums deep into the 21st? Why is Taylor Swift, only now, decades later, beating her chart records? Don’t feel guilty if you haven’t pondered this before. Hit parade won’t let you choose to forget. Trust us, it will be like butter.

Speaker B: We simply choose to forget. Do you want for me? Why don’t you run for me? Why are you wondering? Why do you know? Why aren’t you scared of me? Why do you care for me?

Speaker A: When we just got through another Grammy awards cycle in which a slew of young women in their twenty s and early 30s swept the prizes? And it got me thinking about past winners. Winners like Billie Eilish, who in 2020 became the youngest person to take home album of the year when she won for her lp. When we fall asleep, where do we go? Eilish was a little over a month past her 18th birthday.

Speaker B: I want to end me I want to end me.

Speaker A: It was an impressive feat, but Eilish was not the first Grammy winner to take the big prize on her debut album at a precocious age. Back in 1964, just three weeks past her 22nd birthday, Barbara Streisand won the same prize for an lp recorded when she was still only 20.

Speaker B: You do cry, cry me.

Speaker A: It was a Grammy benchmark that Streisand held for more than 30 years until Alanis Morissette won the prize at a slightly younger age in 1996. Decades before Billy, before Alanis, before Taylor, Barbara was showing what an assertive young woman could achieve. And speaking of Taylor for the first.

Speaker B: Time, you made a rebel ever killed careful daughter. You are the best thing that’s ever been mine.

Speaker A: Just last summer, when Taylor Swift debuted atop the Billboard 200 album chart with her lp speak now, Taylor’s version, it became Swift’s 12th career number one album. That made Swift the woman with the most number one lps in chart history. And who did Taylor beat for that milestone?

Speaker B: Yep, every mountain foot, every street.

Speaker A: Barbara Streisand scored her 11th number one album less than a decade ago in 2016. By the way, Streisand remains the only act to have achieved number one albums in six decades, the 1960s. Taylor Swift has quite a ways to go to equal that benchmark. And even though we’re almost halfway through the Streisand is nearing her 82nd birthday, I wouldn’t put it past her to top the album chart again. So that’s how Streisand came back on chart followers Radar last summer. Then in November, she landed on everybody else’s radar with the release of her long, long awaited autobiography, my Name is Barbara. How long awaited? Reportedly, former first lady and then double day book editor Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis asked Streisand to pen a memoir back in 1984, not long after the thousand page book dropped in November 2023, word got around that the best way to read the book was to let babs read it to you.

Speaker C: Both of my albums were now in Billboard’s top ten. The second album got all the way to number two. Do you know who kept me from reaching number one? The singing nun Dominique, and something like that. People just couldn’t get that catchy refrain.

Speaker A: Out of their heads.

Speaker C: I guess I never did dislodge her.

Speaker A: Yes, that is Ms. Streisand herself, narrating her own audiobook in that legendary Brooklyn accent. I’m in the middle of listening to it. I’ll admit I’m not done. But in my defense, the audiobook’s total running time is 48 hours. As you can hear, Barbara is chatty, kibitsy, and often riffs extemporaneously on her own writing. And the best parts are like a good podcast. Like when she dissects her own music.

Speaker C: That song just swings along and is much more fun. You hear those squeaks that punctuate the opening bars. That’s very Peter Matt’s. It’s a very particular sound.

Speaker B: I love your love and arms. They hold a world of charm.

Speaker A: Consuming all this Barbara content, I realized something. For all her stature as a cultural figure, Streisand is not as well remembered as she should be as a pop hitmaker. By her own admission, she wanted to be an actress first, and she eventually became the ultimate multi hyphenate star of stage and screen, a film director, tv producer, a political activist, even a meme. Go ahead, Google the Streisand effect to find out how she tried to prevent photos of her waterfront mansion from appearing on the Internet and stepped into some very online Michigan. But what ultimately gave Streisand all those opportunities, even the memes, was her voice. And that voice appeared on almost four dozen hot 100 hits, more than half of them top 40 hits, and we.

Speaker B: Got nothing to begin.

Speaker A: Even babs herself professes some ignorance about this. In her memoir, she sheepishly claims to be obtuse when it comes to hit making.

Speaker C: The songs I chose were not exactly commercial. I never went into the studio thinking I’ve got to record a hit. Of course I was happy if a song went to number one, but that was not my motivation. To this day, I don’t even remember which songs reached the top spot. So the world of top ten Billboard singles was not my world.

Speaker A: While part of me is skeptical of this, after all, Streisand does seem to still hold a grudge against the chart blocking feats of the singing nun. In a way, she has a point. When it came to music, at almost no point in her career was Barbara Streisand trendy. Even when she was topping the charts, it was with music that generally ran counter to the prevailing sounds on the hit parade. Her secret weapon was voice, and that voice created its own weather, its own chart trends. In the most literal sense of this word, Streisand was always exceptional.

Speaker B: Ain’t it a shame? But no one.

ADVERTISEMENT

Speaker A: So yes, reckoning with the irve of Barbara Streisand means reckoning with a lot of schmaltz and stuff, like the idea that people who need people are the luckiest people in the world. By the way, Barbara says in the book that she doesn’t think that lyric makes any sense either. In any case, I see Barbara Streisand’s career as a bridge between the old pre rock days of the great american songbook and the modern post rock era of pop as everything music. Mind you, I don’t expect babs to ever be nominated for the Rock and Roll hall of Fame. But if you consider yourself a poptimist, as I do, then you have to reckon with her music, which has made a lot of people across the cultural spectrum very happy. So let’s try to boil down Barbara Streisand’s EgoT level career to its musical highlights. Even in attempting this, you have to contend with all facets of the woman she was always in her heart, a showgirl with dreams of starring on the great white way but not necessarily singing. And she nearly missed Broadway’s golden era. On the charts, they call you Lady Luck, but there is room for doubt.

Speaker D: At times.

Speaker A: You have a very this is Marlin Brando in 1950, Five’s Guys and Dolls, a filmed adaptation of the hit Broadway musical. One of the 20th century’s greatest actors, Brando, unlike Barbara Streisand, wasn’t much of a singer. But Streisand was mesmerized when she saw him on screen at age 13 at Brooklyn’s King’s Theater. According to her memoir, it was one of the first times she thought musical theater might be for her. Decades later, by the way, Streisand and Brando became friends luck be a lady tonight luck if you’ve ever been a lady to begin with luck be a lady tonight. Born in 1942 and raised in Brooklyn, Streisand started singing as early as fourth grade. But when she started venturing into Manhattan in her early teens to see Broadway shows with a friend, she preferred straight plays like the Diary of Anne Frank or inherit the wind to musicals. She began dreaming of being on stage, but to act, not to sing. She only began to latch onto musical performances when she saw movie musicals like kiss me, Kate or the King and I.

Speaker B: Getting to know you, getting to know all about you getting to like.

Speaker A: The irony was, musicals could not have been hotter on the charts when Streisand was a teenager. As we discussed in our lullaby of Broadway edition of Hit Parade in the mid to late fifty? S, the King and I soundtrack and Broadway cast albums like My Fair lady were number one on Billboard’s lp charts for months on end.

Speaker B: I could have danced all night I could have dance all night and still have begged for.

Speaker A: But it took Streisand a few years to find material she liked. A boyfriend turned her onto the music of Harold Arlin, who became her favorite composer. She especially loved Arlin’s relatively obscure musical house of Flowers and its song Asleep and Bee, made famous by actress Diane Carroll. By the time Streisand started auditioning for shows and appearing in nightclubs in the early sixty s, the golden era of the musical on the charts was nearing its end. Arguably she extended that golden era by a year or two because her 1962 Broadway debut was a sensation.

Speaker B: But no, no, it’s always Ms. Marblestein you think at least Miss M. Day could try.

Speaker A: Streisand originated the role of Miss Marmalstein in 1960. Two’s I can get it for you wholesale, though Marmelstein was a supporting role to Harry Bogan, played by Streisand’s then boyfriend, Elliot Gould. Streisand’s witty performance. She sang the song Miss Marmalstein while wheeling around the stage in an office chair, reportedly stopped the show every night.

Speaker B: I might as well get it off my chest is the drum appellation.

Speaker A: It was only after finding success on Broadway, and remember, Barbara originally wanted only to act, not sing, that she began recording music. Streisand’s first single was a take on happy Days are here Again, the standard made famous during Franklin Delano Roosevelt’s 1932 presidential run. Reimagined by Barbara in 1962 as a torch song, it foreshadowed Streisand’s entire career. When she signed to Columbia Records, Streisand accepted a smaller advance in exchange for the ability to choose her own material. Virtually unheard of control for an artist at that time, especially a 20 year old woman. Recording her first album in early 1963, Streisand eschewed the kind of rock and pop then on the radio, she reinterpreted everything from Disney’s who’s afraid of the big bad wolf?

Speaker B: Who’s afraid of the big Bad wolf? The big Bad Wolf the big Bad Wolf who’s afraid of the big Bad Wolf?

Speaker A: Came the day when fake to her beloved Harold Arlin composition Asleep and Bee.

Speaker B: Asleep and be done told me I.

Speaker A: Will walk with my simply titled the Barbara Streisand album. She rejected Columbia’s proposed title, sweet and saucy Streisand. The lp hit the charts in April 1963 and, despite a lack of radio singles, quickly became a hit, fueled by her budding Broadway fame and a string of charming tv appearances. By the summer of 63, the Barbara Streisand album had risen to number eight on the top lps chart. Streisand moved quickly to record a follow up, the second Barbara Streisand album, which climbed to number two by the fall while her first lp was still in the top ten.

Speaker B: Comes out and the rain stops beating.

Speaker A: By the way, the second Barbara Streisand album was the one that couldn’t get her past the singing nun at the Grammy Awards of 1964. Streisand’s first album went head to head in the album of the year category, with the singing nun as well as Andy Williams chart topper the days of Wine and Roses and trumpeter Al Hertz smash light jazz lp Honey in the hornly Streisand one becoming the youngest ever album of the year Grammy winner. To that date, just weeks past her 22nd birthday, her demand for artistic control had paid off beyond even her expectations.

Speaker B: Happy days are here again, the skies.

Speaker A: Above our in her memoir, Streisand says about her big Grammy night, the awards were not televised back then that she remembers nothing. Which is understandable, because by the spring of 64, Streisand was back on Broadway, this time starring in a musical that would finally get her on the radio.

Speaker B: Don’t tell me not to fly I simply got to if someone takes a spill, it’s me and not you. Who told you you’re allowed to rain on my parade?

Speaker A: Funny girl, the musical adaptation of the life of vaudeville era actress F**** Bryce, seemed to be tailored to Barbara Streisand’s talents. In fact, the creators made Streisand sweat for the role, then spent months tinkering with the show to get the book and the songs right. When Funny Girl finally opened in March 1964, it was not only a smash, one of its songs was already a hit.

Speaker B: People.

Speaker A: Barbara Streisand’s recording of people debuted on the Hot 100 just a week after Funny Girl opened on Broadway. The poignant ballad about empathy and understanding had already built months of buzz during out of town productions and previews for the show, and Streisand recorded the single even before the original cast album was complete. It was not only Streisand’s first Hot 100 hit a dozen weeks after it debuted, people reached number five, becoming her first top five single.

Speaker B: Lover are very special people.

Speaker A: This was remarkable for a couple of reasons. For one thing, Broadway songs and cast albums were no longer commanding the charts as reliably as they had in the early 60s. For another thing, the 22 year old Barbara was competing with an even bigger 1964 chart, youth Quake. Beetlemania.

Speaker B: It’s been a hard day at night and I’ve been working like a dog.

Speaker A: It’S been a Hard Day the beatles commanded the Hot 100 and the album chart for most of the summer of 64. With their song, movie and soundtrack lp a Hard Day’s Night, the Funny Girl cast album did manage to reach number two on top lps before the hard days night lp arrived and took the number one spot for 14 straight weeks. In the meantime, Columbia got Streisand back into the studio to record an entire lp called people, built around the Broadway single. When the people album arrived in the fall of 64, people need people.

Speaker B: All the luckiest people.

Speaker A: Amazingly, it ousted the Beatles from the top of the album chart, giving Barbara Streisand her first number one lp. People stayed at number one for more than a month until just before the Christmas season. For the next two years, while Streisand continued to play F**** Bryce on Broadway, she turned out a string of hit lps, including the soundtracks to two tv specials. All of them made the top five on the album chart. Though Streisand’s singles were not massive hits, she did crack the top 40 in early 1966 with a cover of Secondhand Rose, a song made famous by F**** Bryce.

Speaker B: Second hand hat, second hand clothes that’s why they call me secondhand ro the.

Speaker A: Relentless pace of Barbara’s schedule began to take its toll around 1967. Finally freed of her stage commitments, Streisand returned to the studio and recorded both a regular studio album and a Christmas album, releasing them the same week in October 67. The holiday album was the greater success, topping Billboard’s special Christmas lps chart jingle.

Speaker B: The jingle, the jingle all the way oh, what fun it is to write in a one also one slay, hey jingle the Jingle, the jingle all the.

Speaker A: Way but Barbara’s regular albums started missing the top ten, and between 1967 and 69, none of her singles made the top 40. Of course, Streisand had other ambitions at this time. She finally kicked off her Hollywood career in 1968 with the movie version of Funny Girl, which not only became a box office blockbuster and a hit soundtrack, it also gave Streisand her first Oscar in her debut film role. At the 1969 Academy Awards, Barbara was given her statuette by screen legend Ingrid Bergman under unprecedented Oscar circumstances.

Speaker B: The winner? It’s a tie. The winners are Catherine happer in lion in the Winter and Barbara Streisand. Hello, gorgeous.

Speaker C: Well, I’m very honored to be in such magnificent company as Catherine Hepburn and Gee whiz.

Speaker B: It’s kind of a wild feeling.

Speaker A: As amazing as this was, Streisand’s pivot to Hollywood had taken her eye off the pop charts. Even as the charts were pulling ever further away from the pop standards she loved. She was gamely trying to keep current on Broadway. The new sensation was the musical hair, which by 1969 was generating hit songs as well.

Speaker B: Baby, layer, mama everywhere, daddy, daddy.

Speaker A: For her 1969 album what about Today? Streisand’s first album composed entirely of contemporary pop songs. She covered the hair song Frank Mills, but the single did not chart.

Speaker B: He has gold chains on his lap jacket, I know.

Speaker A: Or after the duo of Paul Simon and Art Garfunkel took over the charts in 1968, wish I was a Kelly.

Speaker B: Cornflake floating in my boat taking movies relax.

Speaker A: Barbara tried her hand at their diddy punkies dilemma, but it too did not chart.

Speaker B: Wish I was a Kellogg’s cornflake floating.

Speaker A: In my streisand even tried covering the Beatles for the first time in 69. Perhaps unsurprisingly, she homed in on Paul McCartney’s music hall style diddy from the white album Honey Pie, honey Pie, you.

Speaker B: Are making me crazy I’m in love but I’m lazy so won’t you please.

Speaker A: But yet again, Barbara’s take did not chart, and the what about today lp peaked at number 31, Streisand’s lowest charting album of the 60s.

ADVERTISEMENT

Speaker B: Honey, you are making me crazy I’m in love but I’m lazy so won’t you please come home.

Speaker A: An interesting footnote was that Bob Dylan penned his 1969 top ten hit Lay lady Lay with the intention of singing it as a duet with Streisand, but he never managed to get in touch with her. Leila delay lay across our big friends be in 1969. Barbara really could have used that hit stay with your man. What finally got Barbara Streisand back on the charts was a shift in the zeitgeist away from hippie rock toward singer songwriter pop, especially by women songwriters. And by the early 70s, Streisand found some songwriters who were kindred spirits.

Speaker B: I love you though always in those.

Speaker A: Devotion, Laura Nero, the New York performer who’d penned a string of hits for acts ranging from the fifth dimension to three dog night and Blood, sweat and Tears, was already something of a songwriting legend by 1970. That’s when Streisand, at the encouragement of journeyman producer Richard Perry, whom we discussed in our Pointer Sisters episode of Hit Parade, covered Nero’s 1967 song Stony End. And it was a truly new sound for Barbara.

Speaker B: Going down the stone.

Speaker A: The shambling, soulful stony end proved an unusual but compelling fit for Streisand’s voice. Evoking a gospel like tone, Stony End not only became Streisand’s first top 40 hit in half a decade, it climbed to number six on the Hot 100 by early 1971. That same year, in a similar mode, Streisand heard Carol King’s blockbuster album Tapestry, and she admired its deep cut, where.

Speaker B: You lead, where you lead I will follow anywhere that you tell me to if you need.

ADVERTISEMENT

Speaker A: And so Barbara covered Carol as well, taking where you lead into the top 40 twice. A studio recording reached number 40 in 1971, and a live version performed by Barbara at a fundraiser for democratic presidential candidate George McGovern, reached number 37 in 1972.

Speaker B: Wanting you the way I do I only want to be with you and that would go to the end of the earth.

Speaker A: Still, by 1973, Streisand had yet to score a number one pop single. The trick was choosing the right material, and sometimes she let potential chart toppers get away. She turned down at least two songs that eventually became number one hits for other singers, Helen Reddy’s Delta dawn.

Speaker B: In her younger days, they called her Delta dawn prettiest woman you ever laid.

Speaker A: Eyes on and Maureen McGovern’s the Morning after, which not only topped the charts but won the Oscar for Best Original Song at the 1973 Academy Awards.

Speaker B: It’s not too late we should be giving only with love can we cry.

Speaker A: But if Barbara’s music career was erratic, her movie career was now on fire. In 1970 and 72, she starred back to back in the romantic comedies the Owl and the Pussycat and what’s up, doc? Each a box office smash. By 1973, she was teed up to star in a period romantic drama from director Sidney Pollock about a female political activist who becomes involved with a writer and war veteran played by Robert Redford at his matinee idol peak, Streisand did not always record songs for the films she acted in, but the one she recorded for this film became a standard.

Speaker B: Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were.

ADVERTISEMENT

Speaker A: The title song for the movie, the way we were, was written by score composer Marvin Hamlich and husband and wife songwriters Alan and Marilyn Bergman. Its lyrics were wistful, recalling the highlights of a cherished but untenable romance with nostalgia and warmth.

Speaker B: Memories like the corners of my mind Misty water color column memory of the.

Speaker A: Way, released as a single in the fall of 1973, just ahead of the release of the movie, Barbara Streisand’s the way we were climbed the charts while the film dominated the box office. In February 1974, just as it was nominated for the Academy Award for Best Original song, the way we were topped the Hot 100, Streisand’s first ever number one single, and stayed at number one for three weeks. It was still in the top 40 by early April, when the song won that Oscar, and its longevity meant that it loomed large over 1970. Four’s hit parade eight months later on american Top 40s year end show, Casey Caseum counted it down. The song that comes in at the number one position in our countdown of the 100 top hits of 1974. It was written by Marvin Hamlish and it was sung by Barbara Streisand. Here it is. If there’s one song most associated with Barbara Streisand, the way we were is probably it. It’s the song that solidified Streisand’s reputation as your mom’s favorite singer. Indeed, more than a decade later, the Tom Hanks movie big riffed on this when Hanks’s boy, trapped in the body of a man proves who he is to his mother by singing it to her over the phone.

Speaker B: Memories.

Speaker D: Like a corner of my mind misty water called her memories of the way we were scattered pictures.

ADVERTISEMENT

Speaker A: The way we were so permeated mid 70s culture that it also inspired crossover covers. In 1975, the great Gladys Knight and the Pips took a live medley of the way we were, plus the show tune try to remember to number eleven on the Hot 100 and number six on the r and B chart.

Speaker B: Can it be that it was all so simple then? Oh, has time rewritten every line.

Speaker A: Speaking of R B, Streisand herself was covering even more contemporary material. She adapted all in Love is Fair, a deep cut from Stevie Wonder’s inner Visions LP.

Speaker B: But all the spare love I had to go away.

Speaker A: Into a single that went top ten on Billboard’s easy listening chart and helped push the way we were lp to number one on the Billboard album chart.

Speaker B: Ahead lies mystery, but all is there in love.

Speaker A: Streisand now had the clout, both at the box office and on the charts, to not only headline a movie, but produce it and make it a musical. In 1976, she would take a Hollywood classic and reimagine it as a music business fable and a showcase for both her acting and her singing. She remade a star is Born for a deep dive on Streisand’s ultimate vanity project. I encourage you to go back to our Lady Gaga episode of Hit Parade, in which I detailed the differences among the four, count them, four versions of a Star is Born. This tale of a budding female starlet who rises while her drunken male romantic partner Falls has proved very adaptable what started as a film business tragedy in 1937 starring Janet Gaynor and was remade as a musical in 1954 with Judy Garland, was transformed by Streisand in 1976 into a story about the music business costarring her and Chris Christopherson. By the way, the 2018 version starring Lady Gaga and helmed by Bradley Cooper, is essentially a reboot of the Streisand version. All of the versions of this movie satirized the star making machine, but Streisand’s a Star is Born was conceived by her as a vehicle to give her the swagger of a contemporary rock star.

ADVERTISEMENT

Speaker B: Your pleasure is hot. I will be good on the people. I don’t.

Speaker A: The project also gave Streisand clout in one other area. As a songwriter. In her decade plus as a recording artist to date, she had almost entirely sung songs penned by others, taking only a couple of minor co writing credits. But for a Star is Born, Streisand taught herself guitar and came up with a few chords that she thought sounded like a song. She took them to songwriter Paul Williams, who added lyrics and completed Barbara’s composition. Evergreen. The love theme from a Star is Born did for that movie what the way we were had done three years earlier. It was released with Rose alongside and defined the movie as a star is Born swamped the box office. It became the third highest grossing film released in 1976. Evergreen debuted on the Hot 100 in December 76 and climbed to number one by March of 77.

Speaker B: They warm and excited cause we have the brightest love.

Speaker A: Also like the way we were. Evergreen was nominated for an Academy Award, but when the way we were won in 74, its songwriters Marvin Hamlish and the Bergmans took home the Oscar. This time, Barbara herself, along with Paul Williams, was nominated for the prize. And at the 1977 oscars, Barbara’s friend and fellow Brooklynite Neil diamond took special pride in announcing the winner.

Speaker D: Before I, before I mentioned the winner, about three weeks ago, I was talking to Barbara and I said I love your song so much that no matter who wins, I’m going to read your name. But I have to cancel out on that. Barbara so if I call your name out, you actually won. And if I didn’t, if I don’t call your name out, that means you wrote a fantastic song first time out. We’ll see. The winner is Evergreen. Barbara Skyzone, Paul Williams.

ADVERTISEMENT

Speaker C: In my wildest dreams, I never, never could ever imagine winning an Academy Award for writing a song. I’m very honored and excited. Thank you all very much.

Speaker A: Evergreen not only gave Streisand her second oscar as a song, it finally made her an imperial chart presence. Now singles of Barbara’s would more consistently crack the top 40. A spring 1977 single, for example, my heart belongs to me, shot straight into the top ten, peaking at number four.

Speaker B: My heart belongs to me but not my life.

Speaker A: A year later, speaking of Neil diamond, he and Barbara were the beneficiaries of an OD coincidence that we discussed just two months ago on hit parade in our second chance hits edition, after Neil co wrote and recorded a heartbreak ballad called you don’t bring me flowers.

Speaker D: You think I could learn how to tell you goodbye? Because you don’t bring flowers?

Speaker A: And Streisand recorded the same song in the same key on her own 1978 solo lp.

Speaker B: Do you think I could know how to tell you goodbye? Cause you don’t bring me flowers anymore.

Speaker A: An enterprising dj spliced together the two recordings to turn you don’t bring me flowers into a duet. Inspired by the dj’s makeshift mashup, diamond and Streisand went into the studio for real to rerecord flowers as an actual duet. That single shot to number one in the fall of 1978.

Speaker D: They just lay on the floor till.

Speaker B: We sweep them away baby, I remember all the things you taught me.

Speaker A: In turn, that success sent Barbara’s 1978 compilation greatest Hits Vol. Two to number one on the album chart, her fourth number one lp, by the way, after people in 1964, the way we were in 1974, and the soundtrack to a Star is Born. In 1977, Babs was on a roll and feeling brave enough to now try her hand at disco.

Speaker B: I can’t wait, I gotta celebrate.

Speaker A: In 1979, Streisand starred with Ryan O’Neill in a boxing satire slash romantic comedy called the Main Event. Though panned by critics, the main event was a box office hit, and it produced a smash single by Barbara called the Main Event Fight, her first foray into disco. The main event fight peaked at number three on the Hot 100 in the summer of 79.

Speaker B: Cause there’s nobody like you honey, you’re.

Speaker A: The one that summer, the reigning queen of disco was the great Donna Summer, who was commanding the charts with multiple number one hits from her acclaimed double album Bad Girls.

Speaker B: Bad Girl, sad Girl, talking about the.

Speaker A: Sad girl, songwriter Paul Jabara, who had written both Donna Summers 1978 hit Last Dance, and Barbara Streisand’s the Main event Fight, convinced Barbara she should duet with Donna. At the time, Streisand was working on a concept album called Wet, in which all of the songs would have water themes like, for example, her future hit Kiss me in the rain.

Speaker B: Kiss me in the Rain make me feel like a child again.

Speaker A: With a feeling that Paul Jabara and songwriting partner Bruce Roberts had written a fierce disco anthem called Enough is Enough, Streisand asked if they could add some lyrics about water, so they grafted a whole first movement onto the track, a ballad section over a minute long that they called no more tears. And so Streisand agreed to record the song with Donna Summer. Legend has it that in the studio, the two vocal powerhouses sang so hard, at one point Donna fell off her stool. No more tears, parentheses Enough is Enough was essentially a guaranteed smash, the two biggest female pop stars, each at her imperial peak at the time on one song. Debuting in October 1979 on the Hot 100, the single took just six weeks to rise to number one. As I noted at the top of our show, it also took Streisand to number one on the disco chart for the first time, and it even cracked the r b chart. Funnily enough, Barbara caught disco just as it was crashing in the pop marketplace. No more tears hit number one several months after the disco sucks movement and Chicago’s infamous summer 79 Disco demolition night event. What made it doubly ironic was that after scoring a smash with Donna Summer, Streisand was now about to connect with a group even more associated with disco, and she would prove to be their commercial salvation as much as they brought her to new pop heights. By 1980, the leading acts of disco were all finding ways to pivot their careers amidst the disco backlash. Streisand’s friend Donna Summer, not long after their hit duet pivoted toward a fusion of dance, pop and synthesized rock on her 1980 album the Wanderer.

Speaker B: I know I’m ready now it’s just a little time because I’m a wanderer.

Speaker A: I’m a wanderer Chic, the hit making disco group led by Niall Rogers and Bernard Edwards that had revolutionized dance music and even helped launch hip hop in the closing months of 1979, good time.

Speaker B: Good time.

Speaker A: Increasingly turned their attention toward production and songwriting for other acts. Chic’s greatest 1980 triumph was producing and writing the album Diana, the transformative post disco blockbuster by Motown legend Diana Ross.

Speaker B: Upside down boy, you turn me inside out and round and round you might.

Speaker A: Say the Chic approach was also the strategy being pursued by Barry Robin and Morris Gibb, the Bee Gees. They scored the last of their string of Hot 100 number ones in the summer of 79.

Speaker B: Love you Inside and Out.

Speaker A: Which was around the time Barry Gibb met Barbara Streisand. Impressed by Barry’s hit making skill, Barbara asked him if he would write some songs for her next album. Gibb upped the ante. He offered to produce the entire album and write all of the songs with his brothers. All Streisand had to do was show up and sing, even more so than Chic with the Diana LP, Streisand’s 1980 album would be, in essence, a BG’s album fronted and personified by Barbara Streisands of the BG’s production style were all over the LP, but it was lush, urbane pop, not exactly dance music. Barry Gibb had cleverly adapted his style for a singer with a titanic voice and an audience that was now allergic to falsetto, vocals and studio 54 beats. It turned out Barry Gibb could do 80s diva pop as adeptly as he’d done disco. The Streisand album didn’t have a title until near the end of recording, when Streisand asked Gib for one more uptempo song. Barry wrote one with both Robin and Morris, the album’s only song penned by all three Gibb brothers, a bop with a yacht rock style bounce, and Barry sang it with Barbara as a duet. The song and the album would be called guilty and we got nothing to begin. In a remarkable promotional move for Guilty’s album cover, streisand photographed herself in a hug with Barry Gibb, both of them clad in disco era white. Rather than hide the involvement of the lead BG, she was showcasing him, even though her name was the one above the title for the first single, columbia went with the lp’s sultriest song, a pseudo feminist tone poem co written by Barry and Robin Gibb that Streisand found lyrically inscrutable. But nonetheless, she sang the h*** out of it. It was called woman in love, but.

Speaker B: I give you it all you love.

ADVERTISEMENT

Speaker A: To get you into my world, and it was an instant smash, the fastest breaking solo single of Barbara Streisand’s career. Within two months, woman in Love was on top of the Hot 100 the very same week the guilty album reached number one on the album chart. Even for Barbara, this was exceptional, her biggest chart success. Not accompanied by a movie, Broadway show or tv telecast, guilty blew up. Based on the songs and Barbara’s own imperial pop profile. Not only did guilty become Streisand’s top selling studio album ever, quintuple platinum sales in the US alone and a reported 15 million sold worldwide, it also generated the most hits after Woman in Love Barbara and Barry’s guilty duet reached number three and we got nothing to begin.

Speaker B: Our love will climb any mountain we are and we never let it.

Speaker A: And finally, in early 1981, the heartbroken ballad what kind of fool? Another Barry Gibb duet reached number ten.

Speaker B: What kind of, what kind?

Speaker A: It was the last wave of Streisand’s imperial phase on the singles charts, and Barbara made it count. A 1981 compilation called Memories essentially prolonged the guilty era, collecting a handful of Streisand’s recent hits and adding a new song, coming in and out of your life, that rose to number eleven on the pop chart in early 82.

Speaker B: Come and end and out of your.

Speaker A: Life isn’t easy now possessing the clout to get any project greenlit, Streisand took a multi year break from the pop charts to direct and star in her dream project, the movie Yentel, the story of an early 20th century jewish woman in Poland who disguises herself as a man to study the Talmud. The film was both a historical drama and a musical drawing on all of Streisand’s talents. A song from the Yentl soundtrack, the way he makes me feel, briefly cracked the top 40 in late 1983.

ADVERTISEMENT

Speaker B: I’m not sure I understand, but I like the way I feel.

Speaker A: For this film, her directorial debut, Streisand won a Golden Globe, the first woman to win the Globe’s best director prize. Although she was not nominated for best director at the Academy Awards, a controversial snub at the time, not unlike Greta Gerwig’s missed nomination for Barbie in this year’s Oscar race, the music from Yentel was nominated at the 1984 Oscar ceremony. Streisand’s friend Donna Summer sang the movies Papa, can you hear me live? For the record, the Yentl music did win the Oscar for best original song score, a now defunct prize. But in best original song, both Papa, can you hear me? And the way he makes me feel lost out to the theme from Flash dance, the Irene Cara sung Flash dance, what a feeling.

Speaker B: I can’t d***, it.

Speaker A: Was a telling defeat. Four years into the 80s, pop had shifted once again past Streisand’s style of balladry toward synth driven technopop and new wave. When Barbara returned to recording in 1984, she tried to adapt. She worked with iconoclastic songwriter producer Jim Steinman, whom we covered in depth in a prior hit parade episode. Steinman was riding high at the time, having just topped the charts with Bonie Tyler’s bombastic total eclipse of the heart.

Speaker B: And I need you now tonight and I need you more than ever.

Speaker A: And if you only so Streisand took on her own bombastic Steinman power ballad. But the pairing proved a less than ideal fit, serving as the lead single of Streisand’s 1984 album emotion. It was also her first video to appear on MTV. Left in the Dark only reached number 50 on the Hot 100.

ADVERTISEMENT

Speaker B: There are so many things that I just got to know you tell me who, you tell me where, you tell me where.

Speaker A: It had now been almost five years since Streisand had scored a major hit lp. In a counterintuitive move, rather than go deeper into MTV style pop, Streisand sought refuge in the arena where she’d first made her name Broadway. Only she didn’t return to the stage. In fact, after the 60s, Streisand never trod the boards again. Rather, Barbara would bring Broadway to her next album. She called it duh, the Broadway album Columbia. Streisand’s label fought the idea at first. They wanted Barbara to attempt another contemporary pop album, but Streisand’s contract still granted her creative control. So the Broadway album it was. Streisand recorded show tunes by a range of composers, from Rogers and Hammerstein to George and Ira Gershwin. But the lp’s highlights were mainly songs by musical theater legend Stephen Sondheim, who worked directly with Streisand on the lyrical arrangements of her recordings. For the album’s first single, barbara covered the west side Story classic, co written by Sondheim and Leonard Bernstein. Somewhere, Streisand even got Sondheim to write new lyrics for some of his most famous songs, including putting it together from his show Sunday in the park with George or from a Little Night music, the melancholy classic send in the Clowns, which had already been a 70s hit for Judy Collins.

Speaker B: But where are the clown? Quick, send in the clown.

Speaker A: At Streisand’s request, Sondheim wrote a new second bridge for send in the clowns that musically filled in a plot point from the original show. Barbara was the first person to sing this new verse.

ADVERTISEMENT

Speaker B: What a surprise. Who could foresee I come to feel about you what you felt about me?

Speaker A: For theater nerds, these details were delightful. For the record buying public, however, it was potentially very inside baseball. Would it sell? Did it ever. DM 85, the Broadway album went to number one on the album chart by early 86 and ultimately went quadruple platinum, Streisand’s bestseller since guilty, and an album that could not have been less like that previous blockbuster. Now here’s an interesting chart footnote. When the Broadway album reached number one. The lp it ejected from the top spot was the soundtrack to the smash NBC tv show My Vice, starred actor Don Johnson as the pastel wearing Miami cop Sonny Crockett. The show made Johnson momentarily so galactically famous that he briefly pursued a pop career. If you can recall Don Johnson’s 1986 top five hit Heartbeat, you have my sympathies.

Speaker B: I’m looking for a heartbeat.

Speaker A: Why do I bring all this up? Because in late 1987, Don Johnson began dating Barbara Streisand. Uncanny, right? The whirlwind romance, which lasted just under a year, resulted in Johnson’s only other top 40 hit, a duet with Streisand called till I loved you and now.

Speaker B: I can ever imagine my living without you it seems I spend all of my time thinking only about you.

Speaker A: Streisand’s 1988 album, also titled till I loved you, went top ten and platinum. The duet with Johnson? Not so much. It peaked at number 25, by which time he and Streisand had broken up. Never let it be said that Babs is unwilling to share the spotlight. By the late eighty s and early ninety s, the charts were awash in Titanic divas with powerhouse vocals singing like it was an athletic competition.

ADVERTISEMENT

Speaker B: Give me one moment in time when I’m racing with.

Speaker A: Although some of these vocalists emerged from the R B or gospel tradition, in a way they were all following Barbara Streisand, who was the rock era’s premier athletic vocalist. Whether it was Whitney Houston or Mariah Carey.

Speaker B: Your trademark.

Speaker A: Or the vocalist who perhaps most emulated the Streisand approach, Celine.

Speaker B: Dion where does my heart be now I can’t live without.

Speaker A: But by the 90s, Streisand was more focused on her directorial career, not competing with these divas. Barbara helmed 1990 one’s the Prince of Tides, costarring herself with Nick Nolte. Though it was not a musical, Barbara did record a song for the soundtrack that was a minor adult contemporary radio hit.

Speaker B: Never let go of the memories something.

Speaker A: Always seems to remind the 90s was also when Streisand became more of a pop culture icon than an ordinary celebrity, for better and for worse. On the affectionate side, Saturday Night Live’s Mike Myers played performatively jewish talk show host Linda Richmond, who treated Barbara as an object of worship.

Speaker D: This show is dedicated, as ever to Barbara Joan Streisand. Yes, we love her, we love her. And, of course, the big news prince of toys. Seven Oscar nominations total, including best picture, but Barbara did not get a nomination for best director. It’s so unfair. Now I’m getting emotional. I’m a little vocal. Talk amongst yourselves.

Speaker A: By the way, in that 1992 sketch, Linda Richmond’s friend Liz was played by Madonna to show that she was a good sport, Barbara herself surprised both Myers and Madonna by making a cameo.

ADVERTISEMENT

Speaker D: Well, that’s all the time we have this week. My name is Linda Richmond.

Speaker B: And my name is Liz. Barbara, we love you. Hello, gorgeous. The movie was like butter.

Speaker D: Like butter.

Speaker B: All this talk about food. I’m getting hungry, girls. Oh my God.

Speaker D: She is like butter.

Speaker B: I can die now.

Speaker A: In 1993, Robin Williams briefly lampooned Streisand in the hit movie Mrs. Doubtfire. No one in the movie said whom he was imitating. It was meant to be obvious and it was.

Speaker B: Don’T tell me not to.

Speaker A: Live just sit and Potter life’s candy.

Speaker B: And the sun’s a ball of butter don’t bring around a cloud to rain on my parade.

Speaker D: It’s not working. I need to go older.

Speaker B: Older?

Speaker D: You mean like Shelley Winters older or Shelley McLean older? What’s the difference?

Speaker A: Some scotch tape and red hair dying. And on the nastier side, South park creators Trey Parker and Matt Stone depicted Streisand as a narcissist and outright villain in a 1998 episode of their animated series.

Speaker B: I’m going where there’s lucky clovers in the I’m Barbara Streisand. So? Well, so I’m a very famous and very important individual. Like John Elway important? What?

Speaker A: Later in the episode, Streisand enlarges into a godzilla sized villain and wrecks the town, only to be stopped by Robert Smith of the cure. It makes more sense on the show, or maybe less anyway. Notwithstanding South Park’s snide portrayal, these pop culture references to Streisand indicated what a massive cultural figure she had become. Moreover, Mike Myers’comical fan Linda Richmond did accurately portray a significant chunk of Barbara’s fanbase, which gave her music career a solid foundation. The fact was, whatever Streisand issued on disc, a hardcore of Linda Richmond’s were guaranteed to buy it. So, for example, when Streisand issued a sequel to her 1985 Broadway album in 1993, simply titled back to Broadway, close.

ADVERTISEMENT

Speaker B: Your eyes for your eyes will only tell the truth and the truth isn’t.

Speaker A: What you the CD predictably debuted at number one on the Billboard 200 album chart four years later when she released an album loosely themed around inspirational music called Higher Ground, featuring a duet with her protege, Celine Dion. That CD also debuted atop the album chart. Unlike the 60s or the 70s, when Streisand had to prove herself with each project, and certain albums could and did underperform on the charts. By the 90s, she was a known quantity. She could take years off between albums and come back fairly secure that her latest output would be welcomed. She would score nearly half of her record roster of number one albums after age 50. Streisand’s more amazing mid 90s chart feat was that she scored an actual hit pop single. It came from her 1996 film the Mirror has Two faces, her third directorial project. For the soundtrack, Barbara recorded a duet with canadian rocker and frequent movie balladeer Brian Adams titled I finally found someone.

Speaker B: Finally found someone someone to share my life I finally found the world.

Speaker A: Perhaps Babs was benefiting from Brian’s profile more than he was benefiting from hers. Adams was coming off a string of chart topping 90s movie soundtrack hits like everything I do, I do it for you all for love and have you ever really loved a woman? Nonetheless, at age 54, Streisand was scaling the charts again. In December 1996, I finally found someone reach number eight on the Hot 100, her first top ten hit in 15 years since the string of hits from her guilty album. Streisand’s duet even made the top 20 on pop radio playlists, alongside hits by Tony Braxton, Hootie and the Blowfish and Alanis Morrissette.

ADVERTISEMENT

Speaker B: Isn’t it too tight? But you’re exceptional. I can’t wait for the rest of my life.

Speaker A: While I finally found someone was Barbara Streisand’s last Hot 100 hit. She did not settle quietly into the elder stateswoman phase of her career. Babs kept recording new material and landing on various Billboard charts. In late 1999, a duet with country star Vince Gill put Barbara on the Hot Country Songs chart.

Speaker B: If you ever leave me will you take me with you? If you’re ever lonely.

Speaker A: In 2005, on the 25th anniversary of her blockbuster Guilty album, Streisand reunited with Barry Gibb for a sequel album of all new material titled Guilty Pleasures. A top five seller on CD, Guilty Pleasures also generated a dance hit, the neodisco banger Night of my Life, which reached a stunning number two on Billboard’s club Play chart. The club community loves a mature diva.

Speaker B: And nothing can get in my way.

Speaker A: But Streisand’s most age defying 21st century feats were on the Billboard 200 album chart. In late 2009, chart Watchers were eagerly anticipating a new album from pop titan Mariah Carey. Mimi was coming off a string of number one cds and singles like we Belong Together and Touch my Body and her new CD, memoirs of an Imperfect angel, was led by an instant top ten hit obsessed.

Speaker B: Why is so obsessed with me? Boy I wanna know lying that just.

Speaker A: What chart watchers were not anticipating, including Billboard’s own editors who admitted they were blindsided by this outcome, was for a CD released on the same day as Carrie’s Barbara Streisand’s love is the answer to take the number one spot instead.

ADVERTISEMENT

Speaker B: We had a day now that tall in the past spring came along.

Speaker A: This gave Streisand her first number one album of the alts, extending her chart topping prowess into a fifth decade. Five years later, Streisand extended that streak into a 6th decade with her 2014 chart topper Partners. After her long history as the queen of hit duets, Barbara released a new album composed entirely of duets, many of them remakes of her earlier hits. For example, her 1981 hit what Kind of Fool, originally a pairing with Barry Gibb, was reimagined for the Partners album as a duet with soul singer John Legend.

Speaker B: What kind of, what kind of fool?

Speaker A: Partners went gold instantly and eventually platinum. Remarkable at a time when album sales were down across the board and Streisand still wasn’t done pulling album chart upsets. In 2016, she released a sequel called Encore Movie Partners sing Broadway this time, her duet partners were Hollywood stars moonlighting as vocalists. Some of them really held their own with babs, including Star Trek film Heartthrob.

Speaker B: Chris Pine, the Children’s Carousel, the Chestnut Trees, the wishing well.

Speaker D: Oh I be seeing you in every lovely.

Speaker A: The week that the Encore album arrived, Billboard chart watchers were expecting the number one spot to go to the latest album by bro country duo Florida Georgia line.

Speaker B: You’re holy, holy, holy, holy I’m high.

Speaker A: On loving you but yet again, team Billboard underestimated the Barbara Hive. At age 74, Streisand ruled the album chart once again.

Speaker B: Climb every mountain, every stream by going.

Speaker A: To number one and 11th time, Streisand not only reset the record for women, the benchmark that Taylor Swift wouldn’t surpass for another seven years, she also tied her fellow elder singing legend Bruce Springsteen, who, by the way, also has eleven number one albums.

Speaker D: Everything.

Speaker B: Got high hope, I got high hope.

ADVERTISEMENT

Speaker A: Though she has not returned to number one since 2016, Streisand has continued to record and chart her 2018 lp. Walls, whose lyrics were a political protest against then President Donald Trump, generated yet another dance hit when a remix of don’t lie to me reached number eight on the club songs chart. Generations of vocalists continue to revere Barbara Streisand among the most prestigious of her awards was the Kennedy center honors at her 2008 induction. Several musicians performed in Barbara’s honor, including Queen Latifah, Adina Menzell, and Beyonce.

Speaker B: The way we were. The way we were.

Speaker A: Streisand herself has not performed live in several years. She continues to speak out about politics and where she will go to live if Trump is reelected president. Some haters, and she has many, may welcome her exit from public life. Me, I’m hoping she scores one more number one album in the extend that billboard streak into a 7th decade. And regardless of how this fraught political year turns out, I do hope Barbara finds a reason to sing at least one more time.

Speaker B: So let’s tell a word about it now. Happy days are here again.

Speaker A: Preferably the song that launched her unparalleled career all those decades ago, however theatrical and melodramatic, that would indeed be a happy day.

Speaker B: Happy day.
