S1: Sometimes I feel like a case. Sometimes I feel like, hey, everybody, this is Christmas Lamping, host of Slate’s podcast of Pop Chart History. Welcome to The Bridge and The Flintstones. Now you.

S2: That’s Bedrock Anthem by Weird Al Yankovic, a 1993 track from his album Allah Palooza. It was a rare weird alt song that parodies not just one but two songs by the same artist, mainly the Red Hot Chili Peppers. It starts with a riff on their 1992 number two pop hit Under the Bridge, then Segways into a reboot of the chillis number one alter rock hit Give It Away all mashed up with lyrics about that classic cartoon about a Stone Age family, The Flintstones.

S3: And these many episodes bridge are full length monthly episodes. Give us a chance to catch up with listeners and enjoy some trivia.

S4: And I’m delighted to welcome this month’s special guest in the opening paragraph of his new book, Nathan Rayborn writes, About eight years ago, I received a direct message on Twitter from my childhood hero. Weird Al Yankovic that changed my life. Al wrote that of all the writers in the world, he had chosen me to tell his story. Unquote. That book 2012’s Weird Al. The book made Rayborn one of the world’s foremost, our experts. And he’s just released another book, The Weird Accordian to Al that’s winning raves from Al fans worldwide. RAYBON is a former head writer of the A.V. Club, co-host of the Travolta Cage podcast, and the author of six books, including both of his books about Yankovic, neith and Rayborn. Welcome to the Bridge.

S5: It is an honor to be here.

S4: Let’s talk about your weird al phantom, which I have to imagine goes back quite some time, right? I mean, it has been my observation and I’m speaking from my own personal experience that each generation seems to discover Al in their own time, maybe when they hit a certain age. So when was your moment with Weird Al?

S5: Oh, definitely, definitely. Al has kind of a line about that. How every a critic’s favorite weird al album, the best weird Al album is whatever was released when they were twelve years old. Total. Yeah. So I’m proud to say that I got in a little bit young. I remember geez, the first three albums that I ever got that my dad bought for me. And these are album albums. Records. Sure. Beautiful. Beautiful. It is a vital where Michael Jackson’s Thriller, Huey Lewis and the news sports and weird al in. Collectively, this set the bar so high that no other albums could possibly meet it. And I mean that I still think that n3ds is the best album that Al has ever done. And then the very first concert that I ever went to was weird al opening for the monkey. It’s like I went in there and I was primarily a monkey’s fan, but my god, he blew the monkey’s off stage and that similarly set the bar so incredibly high that no other concerts by non weird al artists could could possibly match it. And then yeah, I sort of read about this in the book, but I had kind of a giving tree relationship with Al where at every stage of my my life, my career, he was there. So when I started writing for the A.V. Club in the late 90s, I got to meet him backstage. And I was a very, very, very exciting experience, you know. And then, yeah, he asked me to write his book about 12 years later. And I was actually writing another book at the time about Fish and Insane Clown Posse. And I was the head writer of the A.V. Club. So I should not have written this book, but I could not say no to Weird Al Yankovic. And then, yeah. He was putting out a boxset squeezebox, a 15 disc career spanning box. It ended up winning the Grammy for best package. And it was so expensive that if I write a book about this, then I can write it all off on my taxes and end up being this amazing, amazing adventure. Sure. That took three years to finish. But my God, I’m so unbelievably happy and proud. He not only wrote the interaction for it, he also fact checked it and he copy edited it. He was so he was so mortified by my grammar, by all of my word crimes. They offered his services as a cunning linguist to help me distinguish what’s proper English. What a mensch. I was very, very lucky. Say every stage in my life. Weird. Al has been there for me.

S4: That’s amazing. There’s so much in that I relate to, not least the fact that his live shows is truly amazing. I’m embarrassed to admit I’ve seen it twice, but only in the last decade. And God, I’ve I’ve rarely had so much fun as I have at those two shows. So in the episode I talk not only about Weird Al, that’s kind of the second half of my most recent hit parade episode, but I talk about antecedence to Al. I cited not just his backstory for Al, but really to talk about the history of novelty music on the charts in general. And among the people I point to are Spike Jones, Allan Sherman, Tom Lerer and of course, Dr. Demento, who was not a charting artist himself that helped break people. How did Al synthesize all of these novelty music pioneers?

S5: Well, he kind of took what was best about each of them, and he learned from their example. But he also learned what not to do.

S6: For example, Allan Sherman is a fascinating, fascinating figure. Huge. And he was huge like for a couple of years.

S7: Hello.

S4: Gallo father, three number one albums back to back to back in 1962 in 63.

S6: And then Alan from any kind of lost it all. Dionne You see it access. You know, he’s just a very careless man, very connected career with how he conducted his personal life, dying very, very early. And I think he’ll kind of learn from that. He learned what not to do. He learned to be careful, be cautious, to be very deliberate and meticulous in how to sort of has planned and executed his career. He learned so much from Dr. Demento. I mean, you look at Al and he’s a TV guy.

S5: Obviously, that’s a source of a lot of his sort of biggest hands. His his most popular songs. But he’s also a radio guy. And he has an A in his mind. And our sense of not only what would be successful, but what will endure. You know, if you look at Al’s career, like he’s only really ever parodied a non hit once. And that was a song, Ruthless People by Mick Jagger.

S8: And you can know that it’s not a hit, because if you’re Mick Jagger solo song, it’s about a Rolling Stones.

S5: So that’s part of it. Also, I mean, you just talk about, you know, stuff like better rock anthem, new thing about, you know, not just The Flintstones, which obviously is a huge thing which has, you know, enormous, enormous popularity and cultural resonance. But it was well on the way to being a movie. Good point. And that’s I mean, like Frank Zappa, I think there’s that sense of outrageousness button pushing provocation. So what he did was he kind of took all of these different influences and just kind of created this sort of super. BEISTE to Ian, sort of like the perfect the perfect novelty artist. I almost feel bad calling him an artist because I feel like that is limiting. And I feel like what he’s done over the course of his career is he’s transcended that in a way that almost no other artists have.

S3: Yeah, I would agree. I’m glad you talked about how Al evolved over time a little bit because I wanted to touch on that as well. One of my favorite weird al moments was when he guested on The Simpsons. He did a guest voice on The Simpsons. I think he did it a couple times. And if I remember correctly, it was it was his first, right? It was his first appearance. And it is revealed in the episode. The homer, of course, is a weird Al fan, and that Homer has been sending weird al his own weird al style parody songs and all of them are food related.

ADVERTISEMENT

S9: Did you ever get to parody songs? Yes. Which one was better living with Peter Loka or another one bites the crust? They were pretty much the same.

S4: The riff being, of course, that Al has done himself. So many food related songs. But you in some of your work, I’ve identified that Al is actually thematically moved decade by decade. Do you want to talk about that for a minute?

S5: Oh, definitely. I think one of the thing that makes sort of al unique and fascinating. I feel like he’s kind of a representation of the monoculture of this time in our and American history when people do the same TV shows and the same movies and the same songs. So he kind of in the 1980s, when Al emerged as sort of his main themes were television and food. You know, at that food was literally all he eight- the entire decade of the 1980s. Nothing was bigger than television. You know, television told us we were television sold things to us. Television, you know, gave us the secrets to life. And yet during that time, that was kind of Al’s obsession. And then in the 90s, as soon as he got older, he his stuff became a little more calculating, a little bit more opportunistic. And I was kind of his movie Age. We had songs about Forest Gump, songs about Jurassic Park. You had most famously The Saga Begins, which is a beloved, hilarious song about one of the worst things of all time, which is the plot and characters over The Phantom Menace. And then, you know, as the aughts approached, that kind of began his computer itch, you know, sort of television was supplanted by the Internet. YouTube replaced MTV. And as a result, Al’s reigning obsession became computers and technology and the Internet and how it simultaneously makes our lives better and worse and a whole lot more ridiculous. And yeah, that’s kind of been a source of a lot of his best and most resonant sort of late period hits like White Nerdy, like it’s all about the Pentium and Y2K.

ADVERTISEMENT

S10: Bill Gates call of money. But when I’m making do my tech support.

S5: As culture has changed. Al has changed with it.

S4: You know, and as that Simpsons joke also indicates, this is the gag ride is that all of Homer’s ideas for parody songs are terrible, but it makes the point that truly witty parody is actually hard. So what do you think makes Al’s parodies in particular so effective and exceptional?

S5: I feel like with Al there’s always more going on than just what’s on delay or what’s on the on the surface. I mean, take Amish paradise, for example.

S11: Part of what makes it such a great song. It’s such a funny sciences. The verse of song is that it’s about not just a powerful song and important song by two powerful, important songs, that coolio song that it’s parodying. And then little Stevie Wonder songs that that song is sampling that again, kind of Russian doll element of Al where he’s parodying something that’s sampling something that’s represented some other thing. So again, that’s fascinating to me. So you kind of have this gospel majesty to a very, very silly song that fundamentally is about religious Hip-Hop, which is about arrogance, which is about, you know, the faithful.

S8: But having this piety, that’s also ridiculous, you know. And that’s also a self-absorbed and arrogant.

S12: By resale price limit.

S13: A local boy could be in the blood last week. I just smiled at him. Turn the other cheek.

S5: I feel like the thing we have really talked about, that’s the core of his appeal is nostalgia. You know, I feel like a lot of people they discover out when they’re very, very young and they have enormous nostalgia from that period in their lives in L. But there’s that double nostalgia because not just for the songs that aldehyde, it’s for the songs that he parody. Even now, he’s overlapped with so many, you know, sort of huge cultural thing is whether it’s Star Wars with Jurassic Park, that’s Yoda even like, you know, even Buckingham blew like a very silly kind of album, his first date.

ADVERTISEMENT

S8: Like that has a residence. There’s a whole new drama going on with the royal role in it.

S5: So no matter what’s happening in pop culture, there is a weird al song that references it very, very directly, almost to an uncanny degree.

S3: Let us not forget that when he did, I lost on Jeopardy! That was actually in a Stalder play too, because Jeopardy at that moment hadn’t been rebooted with Alex Trebek. So he was calling back to the, you know, Don Pardo and Art Fleming version of the show. There’s a soldier there, too. Yeah.

S5: Oh, definitely.

S8: Oh, and you’ll get like George of the Jungle, which, you know, again, that’s so true to kind of weird. Al and his aesthetic heard it on, I believe the Dare to Be Stupid album. I was like, oh, this is a song that Ludo created. And it was almost like by covering that’s on. He was like really sort of a movie adaptation into existence.

S5: And by alchemy, combining all these different things, he’s been able to create a blasting career in a field where everything is supposed to be ephemeral.

S4: So speaking of Allen, his career, let’s talk about a little bit about the charts and where his career could go from here if it goes anywhere now that he’s entering his 60s.

S3: I guess what I find interesting about our possibly entering retirement is the idea that there’s never been a better moment for an artist who paints with his, you know, brushes and canvas, right? Yeah. Video makes things go viral, snark and wit and little quirky things right up to the song. That’s number one as we record this, the box by writing Rich.

ADVERTISEMENT

S14: You know, quirky things make songs go to number one. Do you think, Alice, thinking about this?

S3: He certainly thought about it in 2014 when mandatory fun became his first and thus far only number one album. Do you think there’s a place for Al in the chart world of the 2020s?

S5: I definitely think there’s a place for Al in the chart world of the 2020s. I think again, to go back to a recurring theme, Al has executed with incredible care and craft and meticulousness, and I feel like the longer that he is away, the more pressure there is on an album. Al has joked that every album is basically a comeback album because he’s either been away for a little bit or he didn’t get a hit on the last one. So yeah, I definitely feel like there’s a place for him. I feel like he’s in this enviable situation where he doesn’t need to release new music to tour. He doesn’t need to release new music to do talk shows. You know, he has this really nice, really lovely life. And he also has this formula for crafting albums. And usually when you talk about formula and terms of entertainment, it’s in a negative way. It’s and then perjorative sense without it works like he’s figured out a way to make albums to retain relevant and popular and funny and important. And so, yeah, I feel like for him to release it well and there has to be a batch of new pop songs and he really connects with that. He really engages with it. I think as book in the book about how when it comes to the pop world and the people he parodies, he’s like Matthew McConaughey and Dazed and Confused. You know, where he gets older and they stay the same age. So you’re talking about a 60 year old Grammy winning legend having to listen to obnoxious pop songs and think, do. Is there something here that I can grapple on, too? Is there something that’s funny? Is there an angle? Is there perspective? Is there a tack that I can take? Can I make this about burrito some way of say yes or there are so many different things going on. So I hope to hell that he puts out another album. I also feel like when I sent him the according to our book, I wanted to impress them how grammatically correct it was. And he was like, oh my God, this is horrified. I’m going to take several days to go and fix this for you and a sensible professional writer. And my fear is that he was going to take that time and like go to the woods and record his masterpiece. Instead, I’m going to fix this moron’s comments. So I hope that I singlehandedly did not prevent him from releasing a comeback album. But I agree. I think there would be an enormous audience for it. I feel like, you know, he was received with 2014’s album as kind of a conquering hero. And I feel like his stature and his prestige and has only increased in the ensuing years.

S3: Well, I certainly hope, Nathan, that you haven’t singlehandedly prevented Al from creating his next masterpiece, but I feel very, very guilty. You’ve certainly given him plenty to do, at the very least. Fixing your word crimes. JR Thank you so much, Nathan, for joining me for this episode of The Bridge. And can you tell us where folks can find you online?

S5: Oh, sure, sure, sure. You can find yet neither. Even the Happy Place, which is my Web site, I devote all of my time and energy to it. It was kind of the incubator from which the great accordion out came from. It’s a Nathan Ravan dot.com, any THAAD and arabia. and dot com. And then I got the Trouble the Cage podcast with my friend Klint running and where we talk about all of John Travolta and Nicolas Cage, his movies in order, which is a pretty amazing, pretty and pretty crazy experience.

S3: So I just listened to the episode where you guys talked about Urban Cowboy yesterday. And I must say, it was very entertaining. All right. Well, Nathan, thank you so much for joining me on the bridge.

S5: My pleasure. My pleasure. Thanks for having me on.

S3: Now comes the time in every hit parade, the bridge episode where we do some trivia. And joining me on the line from Bellingham, Washington, is Nivea Cote’s. Hey, Iva.

S15: Hello. How are you? I’m good. Very excited.

S3: My understanding is you saw my 20 19 live hit parade show in Seattle, Washington. Is that right?

S16: Yes, we made a whole day of it.

S3: So you were at the live show and at all? My live shows, I ask live trivia questions and people from the audience answer those trivia questions. Why didn’t you answer one of my trivia questions?

ADVERTISEMENT

S16: Well, I. Didn’t really have the confidence at the time. I was a bit shy and it was fun but frustrating because I knew almost all the answers. So that prompted me to join Slate and bet it was just a lovely evening.

S3: It was a lovely evening. But I must say, that particular live show, the Seattle live show, I think only something like three out of my nine contestants got the questions right. I wish we had asked you a question, because I would have liked to get, you know, one more correct answer that night.

S16: Yes. Yes. The one that stands out for some reason is John Lennon because the person up there got it wrong. Oh, I knew that one.

S3: Which reminds me to mention you’re now a slate plus member. So on these hit parade, the bridge episodes, you can be a trivia contestant. And this is the moment in every episode where I remind our listeners that while this bridge episode is available to all hit parade subscribers, we only open our trivia rounds to Slate Plus members. So if you are a member and would like to be a trivia contestant, visit slate.com. Slash hit parade. Sign up. That’s Slate.com. Slash hit parade. Sign up. So Nivea, as you probably remember on all of our prior bridge episodes, we’re going to ask you three trivia questions. The first is going to be a callback to our most recent full length episode of Hit Parade. And the next two are going to be a preview of the next episode. Are you ready for some trivia? I am ready.

S17: All right. Here we go. Question one. Last month we talked about several serious rock titans who scored their biggest chart hit with a novelty single. Which of these legends did not hit their peak on the Hot 100 with a one off comedy hit A, Bob Dylan, B, Chuck Berry. C, Johnny Cash. Or D, Bo Diddley?

S15: Let’s see. That has to be a Bob Dylan.

ADVERTISEMENT

S18: And you are correct, the correct answer is a Bob Dylan.

S14: While some consider his 1966 hit Rainy Day Women Number 12 and 35 a novelty, he’d only spent one week at number two on the hot 100 the year before his like a Rolling Stone, spent two weeks at number two.

S17: But Chuck Berry, Johnny Cash and Bo Diddley all scored their biggest pop hits with my ding a Ling, a boy named Sue and same man, respectively. Excellent. You’re one for one Nivea. Ready for question 2. Ready. Here we go. Question 2 Which of these artists all Rock and Roll Hall of Fame inductees strung together the most consecutive number one hits in Hot 100 history? A, The Supremes. B The Beatles. C the B GS or D, Whitney Houston.

S19: That’s a tough one.

S15: I just gut instinct. I’m going with de Whitney Houston.

S18: Your gut is correct. The correct answer is D Whitney Houston.

S14: Between October 1985 and April 1988, Whitney strung together seven straight number ones on the Hot 100. When she scored the seventh of those chart toppers, she broke out of a tie with the Beatles and the beaches with six apiece. Excellent.

S3: You’re running the table so far and even you’re ready for question 3. Ready?

S17: Here we go. Question 3. After her 1980s peak, Whitney Houston continued to score chart hits into the 21st century. What was her last top 10 hit on the hot 100? A I have nothing. B Exhale. Shoop, shoop. See, my love is your love. Or D, The Star Spangled Banner.

S15: The only one I know of those is did The Star-Spangled Banner, because you just had the Super Bowl and that’s why she sang it and she knocked it out of the park so deep and you knocked it out of the park.

S18: The correct answer is D.

ADVERTISEMENT

S20: The Star-Spangled Banner first recorded for the 1991 Super Bowl. Houston’s now legendary recording of our national anthem returned to the Hot 100 after the 9/11 attacks in 2001 when it reached a new peak of number six. For the record, exhale. She lost her last number one in 1995. And My Love Is Your Love was her last top five hit in 2000.

S4: A perfect score. Phenomenal Nivea. You must be thrilled.

S16: I am thrilled. That was a lot of fun.

S4: Now, I understand that even though you have now run a perfect score, you have the chance to increase your perfection by stumping me with a trivia question. Do you have a question for me?

S16: Yes, I do. Whitney Houston’s rendition of The Star-Spangled Banner was the first version of the song to be certified. Platinum hit the Billboard Top 10, but one honor Whitney’s national anthem does not hold. It isn’t the longest. Both the record for the longest version of The Star-Spangled Banner at the Super Bowl. Is it a Natalie Cole in 1994? B. Faith Hill in 2000. Alicia Keys in 2013. Atena Idina Menzel in 2015.

S21: Wow. Did not see that question coming. And my chart knowledge is not going to help here. So I have to take a guess. That’s what I did. Yeah.

S3: And maybe because I have her on the brain right now because I just watched the Grammy Awards a couple weeks ago.

S22: I’m just gonna go ahead and get see Alicia Keys, Korac, her rendition on the piano clocked in at one hundred and fifty five seconds.

S23: You can see.

S24: Whitney’s memorable version lasted 100, which is remarkable because a detail I’m going to talk about in our next episode is that they added 1 beats per measure to Whitney’s version.

ADVERTISEMENT

S3: So her version is in 4/4, whereas our national anthem originally is in waltz time, which is 3 4. So in theory, Whitney should have taken longer. But go figure. Alicia Keys was actually longer. Well, Nivea. It was a good day for both of us. You and me, because we got all of our trivia questions right. We can both hold our heads up high. And I just want to thank you for being on hit parade the bridge.

S24: Absolutely. My pleasure. Can’t wait to hear the next step.

S25: So as the last two questions of that trivia round indicated, our next full length episode is going to be about Whitney Houston and chart crossover. This month, February 2020 is the eighth anniversary of Whitney Houston’s death. And notably, she is about to be inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame. There’s been a lot of biographical material produced about Whitney since her passing, including two back to back documentaries about her story. And frankly, none of this biographical material, I feel has done justice to her amazing chart feats, not just the feats themselves, but what they say about her career. These chart phenomena say as much about Whitney’s relationship to fame, her fans and race as the more lurid details of her biography. Do so in our next hit parade. We’re going to walk through her amazing chart records, including some that I have not seen chronicled in any biographical information about her and talk about what it tells us about Whitney Houston’s amazing career.

S4: My thanks again to Nathan Rayborn for joining me for this episode of The Bridge, and this episode was produced by Àsia Solution. I’m Chris M.A.. Keep on marching on the one.
