S1: Hey, everybody, this is Chris, M.A., host of Hit Parade, Slate’s podcast of Pop Chart History. Welcome to the bridge.

S2: I got to double the real. That’s the roof by Mariah Carey, a track from her 1997 album Butterfly Carrie not only built this song out of the mob, deep rap classic Shook One’s Part tunes in a 1998 remix of the song.

S3: You have intellectual me.

S2: She invited Mobb deep themselves to rap on the song’s bridge. And as the roof removed, Carey away from her earlier pop centric work to more overt R&B and hip hop, it represented yet another bridge in Mariah Carey’s here.

S4: And these mini episodes, bridge are full length monthly episodes. Give us a chance to catch up with listeners and enjoy some trivia this month. We’re delighted to feature a special guest to help us talk about Mariah Carey. But before we bring him in. We’re going to do some follow up on last month’s full length hit parade episode. And for that, I welcome back to the Mike. My producer for the bridge, Aisha Salud. Hey, Asha.

S5: Hello, Chris. Happy 20:20.

S4: Happy 20:20 to you. So I got a few comments on the most recent hit parade episode, and I wonder if you can characterize a couple of them for me.

S5: Yeah. You know, I was lurking in your Twitter mentions like any good producer would do, and I noticed that everyone was hitting on the exact same question. And that question is the impact of the movie love? Actually, yes. On the trajectory of all I want for Christmas is use pop stardom. Do you think that love actually had a big impact on all I want for Christmas is use rise to the top.

S6: Here’s the facts, folks. There is really very little direct evidence that the appearance of the song in Love actually did much to help. All I want for Christmas is you. On the charts. First of all, the movie was a sizable theatrical hit in 2003, but not an American blockbuster. It grossed about $60 million here, which is nothing to sneeze at. But for a romcom, that is really quite a modest hit. It was never no one at the box office never even came close. Generally, as it has been well-chronicled love actually became kind of a sleeper hit in the United States, mostly on home video, cable television, a slow growing phenomenon. Also, the performance of the song in the film. Let’s not forget is a cover, a very charming one, but sung by a child.

S1: But it’s not by Mariah herself. Now, you might argue, well, yes, but then folks might go and purchase or stream the song. Having seen it in the movie.

S7: And while the Carrie Original was a sizable digital seller in 2003, by the way, coincidentally, the year that Love actually came out was the first year Apple’s i-Tunes music store opened and Billboard was just starting to track digital music, its appearance on Billboard’s digital songs chart. That year seemed to have no connection whatsoever with the movie. It made an appearance a couple weeks before Christmas. The Love actually movie was already falling out of the top 10 by then. In mid-November, when love actually appeared on screens and was doing better, all I want for Christmas is he was not selling especially well at i-Tunes and other digital stores.

S6: So based on the lack of hard data driven evidence, I continue to believe that love actually didn’t have a whole lot to do with why.

S7: All I want for Christmas is you eventually rose to number one. Did it gradually put the song in the minds of more people over the years? Without question. But honestly, the story of all I want for Christmas is you pre-dates love, actually. It first appeared on the Hot 100 as early as the year 2000. It again, as I said in the episode, largely about changing technologies and changes in the way the charts have been formulated. And that is why that Mariah Carey song went to number one in twenty nineteen.

S5: I think that explanation will satisfy the concerned love actually fans. But there’s another subset of people in your mentions who are upset for a reason that I don’t think you’re going to be able to explain your way out of. And that is the whammy. Get inners.

S7: I’m gonna say sorry. Not sorry to the Wham-O getting competitors’. The way WEMA Getin works is you try to get from Thanksgiving to Christmas without once hearing the song last Christmas.

S1: A song that, by the way, not unlike Mariah’s. All I want for Christmas is you is getting more popular every year in the streaming era. This year, a peek just outside of the top 10 on the billboard hot 100. So that’s an extremely popular song. It was probably impossible for us to do that episode without playing last Christmas hit parade listeners.

S5: Thank you so much for sending us your feedback. We always appreciate it. And we’re here for whatever feelings you are listening to.

S4: Hipper it brings up here, here now that we’ve cleared all that up. I’m thrilled to welcome our special guest. I first encountered Rich just–we &c. more than a decade ago when we were both writing for the music blog Idolaters. I have long admired his work on a range of topics, including pop music for numerous outlets. He is currently a senior writer at Jezebel and right here at Slate, he co writes the advice column How to Do It. Perhaps most pertinent to our discussion today, Rich is a Mariah Carey fan. Not sure if he’s a lamb. And he has written about Carey for The New York Times and Pitchfork Rich. Welcome to the bridge.

S8: Thank you. I would say I’m Liam. Yeah. Would you? Yeah. I mean, I guess, you know, I think I fit, you know, insofar as that is an actual designation people have. I think I fit the criteria.

S9: Okay. Good. So let’s take it all the way back. Were you a fan from back in 1990? You know, how long have you loved her music?

S10: I was. But there’s like it’s a weird thing because I was also a kid in 1990. So basically anything that was popular, I liked and like I like just pop music in general. And I remember hearing vision of love and figure it was Whitney Houston.

ADVERTISEMENT

S11: Sure. You know. Understandable, yeah. Yeah, totally. It’s kind of funny because they do really have different voices and they do very different things with them.

S10: But just the tone was Whitney’s tone was so unique that to hear anybody even approximate it was like, oh, this is a new Whitney Houston song, which was weird because I think I can’t remember if I’m your baby tonight came out before or after.

S11: Later that year, later that year. OK, so so then even more reason to be like, oh, here’s Whitney’s new single. So I remember that period that week or so period.

S10: But now we just hear vision of love and be like, Oh, Whitney. And, you know, there wasn’t the Internet bagmen to look up who’s singing the song. Right. So I definitely liked her a lot. I mean, I really liked emotions a lot, too, which was her second album and kind of a deviation.

S11: She was able to have a little bit more creative control in that record was more R&B, more disco.

S9: Straight away. Right. I mean, emotions in particular is basically in a marriage to the emotion. Yes. Best of my love.

S8: But then and then I kind of like in college in the late 90s just was like, I don’t like pop music anymore, which was really just when we all go through and. Yeah. After a similar phase. Totally. And then it wasn’t until Glitter was coming out that I was like, oh, I should like look at. I should pay attention to her because this looks like a disaster. And I was already sort of acclimated to loving, you know, big budget disasters and glitter wasn’t super big budget, but just sort of like failed events in culture. You know, I had seen Showgirls opening weekend, so glitters coming out. I’m like, this could be even showgirls. It’s not, unfortunately. But also, I’m paying attention to Mariah at that point and like the cracks are showing. And then she just becomes this like I mean, she she implodes. You know, she she has a breakdown. Whatever it was, it’s sort of unclear. I actually went through all of those old stories as they appeared in The Post and Daily News, and they were sort of conflicting. And I really do think that like the failure of Loverboy as well as just the album, probably compounded her mental health at that time because she had never flopped before. Right. I think that that was just devastating to her on a very fundamental level because she was such a golden child. She was this over achiever. You know, it was like she talks a lot about her high school days and how she wasn’t that great of a student, but she always clearly had it in her to be a great student. It’s just that she was a great student in the world of pop music, you know, straight A’s. Right. For years and years and years. And then she’d like fails with glitter. And it takes a few years to get her career back on track. But that’s the most exciting stuff for me. That’s the most fun. Do you have a favorite album, a favorite track? I you know, this is like a very, very challenging opinion. This nobody agrees with me on on this particular point, but equals M.C. squared. I think it’s her most consistent album. Interesting. And that’s the 2008 album. Yeah, that’s post Emancipation of Mimi, right?

S11: The lead single was Touch My Body, which I mean, firstly, that song is called Touch My Body and you know, from Jump. That’s the title. It’s also the most like you know, it’s like the dream and Tricky Stewart’s thing of their little twinkling, like mincing sort of, you know, bass heavy style. I think it’s sort of the epitome of that. You know, the first dream single sortie is the shit was very much that.

S8: Just a little punky piano fireball show.

S12: Yeah. Right.

S11: And what’s interesting moment for the sound of R&B. Totally. Just this weird cartoonish like. Like so. I don’t know.

S10: It’s so syrupy sweet in a way, but it’s got the real sort of bass heaviness to it. I just love it. I think Touch my body is just the epitome of that track.

S9: I listen to touch my body in preparation for this full-length December episode for the first time in years. And her vocal tone is different on that single. Yeah, pretty much any hit. I’m certainly not dissing it and I think I’m praising it. It’s even got a Madonna like quality in some ways and it’s playful in a way that she isn’t. Normally, I liked it better than I remembered it. Oh yeah.

S10: Yeah. I think that’s another major distinction that for whatever reason, probably owing to technique. I mean, she talks about nodules. But look, the fact of the matter is, you cannot. Blair for decades and and keep the same quality of voice short. So around 1997 with Butterfly. She started singing differently. She started introducing the more whispery sort of thing on on on a grander scale.

ADVERTISEMENT

S11: She’d have a track here in there where she would kind of whisper, but Butterfly was really this kind of like sensuous cooing thing. Whether she had to do that or not, it’s very clear to me that and in 2020, Mariah Carey’s voice is not what it was 30 years ago. I think it’s held up pretty well considering. I think, though, that she became more soulful when she really had to try.

S13: And I don’t know, I would rather I would actually rather hear her sing now than than even though I go back and look at some of those early performances and just totally astounded.

S9: So since you have great familiarity with, you know, the Lambs and Mariah’s fan base, I find Mariah Carey fans are obsessed ha-ha-ha with her billboard chart record. Yeah. Do you think that fandom for her vocal acrobatics mirrors that of her chart feats with these fans?

S10: Yeah, I think it’s impossible to to to extricate the two. Like she’s always sort of. She can’t. I mean, so she comes out and she has from her first album for singles, they all go to number one second album, first single, emotion’s number one as well. That’s a streak of five, which I believe was the record at the time of those still as. Yeah. Well what about for a debut. For a debut. For debut. Because like she broke the Jackson 5’s record which they opened their career with for she opened with FOBT. OK. Out of the gate, number one. Number one, number one, the number ones, the charts, statistics. As much as she sometimes pretends like it doesn’t matter or she doesn’t know how many number one she has, she clearly does. It’s just part of her. It’s just this this whole thing. And now the fact that she will seemingly never have a number one hit ever again and then manages to do so a dozen years later, a dozen years.

ADVERTISEMENT

S8: But but but we belong together as well. I mean, don’t forget that people did counter that. It was crazy. Yeah. Yes. So that like now this is a pattern her in her career that’s sort of coming back and not just coming back, but coming back to number one. So I don’t think you could ever delete that. And you see these fans talking. I mean, it really reminds me of sort of like sports fans or something with statistics.

S10: And I don’t that’s probably not. Well, certainly at this point, it’s clearly not unique to Mariah. But I would assume that that was sort of baked in early with this fandom, more so than any. I think that people cared about this and like the late 90s, you know. Right.

S9: I would say that the Mariah Carey fans were the first set of fans I encountered online who were not only protective of their favorite. You see that with all good fan groups, but they were vigilant about chart stats. Right. You know, in a way that is a chart nerd from myself. I was like, wow, this is new. They’re not just into the music. They’re like, oh, don’t you forget about that number one hit.

S8: Yeah. Yeah. You know. And so now, do you want to say, too, about speaking about being protective of, you know, your favorite? Is this there’s this modern convention of fandom that I don’t understand where it’s like I have to take this person so seriously? Yes, they’re incapable of flaw.

S10: And to me, the flaws are what make a pop star fun. I don’t want a perfect package. I want somebody who’s going to mess up sometimes. You know, I want somebody who’s ridiculous. I don’t want somebody who’s like hand I’m holding the entire time we’re on the same page. No part of the fun of liking something is to deviate and appreciate it beyond its intentions. You know, total this. I do not understand the way that people on Twitter, I assume young kids, although sometimes it’s Madonna fans and Mariah Carey fans and it’s like you cannot be a you’re too old. I know you’re too old in this way of just like. No, you’re about 15. You’re arguably too seriously. It just it just astounds me. The idea that like, oh, my pop diva can do no wrong, when to me the wrong is more than half the fun.

S7: So what about all I want for Christmas is you I realize we’re having this conversation in mid-January and right, by the way, for those who follow the charts. All I want for Christmas is you just set an interesting and maybe dubious chart record. It just plummeted from number one on the hot 100 to off the chart. The first single in hot 100 history to go from number one to not on the chart at all. And let’s not throw shade of Mariah for this. It’s the end of Christmas. People are done with that record. Nonetheless, I half wonder, is this going to be her song for the vaults? It was something I even posited in the episode that like 30 years from now, it’s entirely possible that this is the record that Mariah Carey is going to be remembered for. The way Brenda Lee, who was a hitmaker at the turn of the 60s, is now largely remembered for rocking around the Christmas tree. Are we headed that way or where do you think her legacy falls? vis-a-vis the Christmas record?

S10: I mean, it’s quite possible. There’s no reason really for people to remember anything when they’re being bombarded with new information and so much of it all the time. I mean, I wonder about the legacy of all of the people. You know, I wonder what will people recognize Prince’s brilliance in 20, 30, 50 years? You know, so I think if you if you’re able to have that one, that’s better than most people are going to get.

S9: Right. In years to come, Mariah fans are going to be obsessively wondering whether the Christmas record is gonna go back to number one. However, and I put my chartered hat on when I ask this next question that won’t give her a 20th. Number one hit. Now it’s going to need to be a new song. So the Beatles question, the Beatles have 20 number one hits. Mariah has now crept one song closer. She’s at 19. Number one hits. Do you think there’s any chance at all the Mariah can capitalize this and record something new that would bring her back to number one?

ADVERTISEMENT

S8: I mean, I know she’ll try. I know she’ll die trying. I do. You know, it’s I don’t know if I find it strange that she hasn’t collaborated with some very obvious people like Drake who like why on why did cause 40 produced GTM FO.

S11: That’s an interesting point. And she there was kind of rumblings about her working with Drake. To me, that song sounds like, oh, this is a song with a Drake remix that goes to number one cause Drake’s on it. Right.

S10: You know, she she she campaigned pretty hard. I mean, she set on watch what happens live. That she wanted Cardi B on be A no.

S14: Nobody wants to know texted. I would love it if you collaborated with Cardi B. Will that ever happen?

S15: I would love for that to happen. This song you guys were just playing. No, no. Which was originally Lil Kim song. We love Kim. Yeah. And I was hoping that the three of us could do a collaboration party.

S8: He did not do that clearly. I think it came down to Cardi B saying no.

S10: So I see Mariah going to number one as a result of a collaboration. Maybe. But I don’t know. I mean, I am incredibly doubtful that she gets another number one. I will not be surprised at all if her next record is a Christmas record.

S16: That is probably a pretty safe bet, which would be her third. Yes. So there is merry Christmas. Merry Christmas to you. She could have slipped the numeral with the Roman numeral two in it. So I’m thinking like Christmas three, my Christmas tree three. Some kind of play. Sure, it will. It won’t be surprising if any woman who names or records the elusive Chantix is going to come up with something funny for the title of Memoirs of an Imperfect Angel. She’s she’s quite a titler. She definitely has that.

S17: So now comes the time in hit parade, the bridge where we do some trivia. And joining me on the line from New Mexico is Josh. Josh, are you there?

S18: Yeah, yeah. Hi, Chris. Hey, how are you? I’m great today. Thanks.

S7: And Josh, please say hi to our guests. Rich just–we, OK, who’s joining us for this episode, Highbridge.

S18: Good to be on the line with you. Hey, Josh.. Same here.

S7: So thank you so much for participating. I assume you have been a hip read listener for some time.

S18: Yeah, no, that’s right. I started listening to you as soon as I found out about it in The Culture Gabfest.

S16: Oh, that’s great. Do you have a particular favorite among our hit parade episodes? Well, yeah.

S18: The Stevie Wonder episode for me was fantastic and I learned so much. I finally figured out why Stevie Wonder’s band was so incredibly tight. And that was because it was just Stevie Wonder, if not all the time.

S16: But a significant percentage of the time, it really was just him himself. Like on superstition, it’s mostly him in a couple of.

S19: It’s completely amazing, blew my mind.

S7: Also, I would like to ask if you are a slate plus member.

S18: Yes, I am. I’ve been a slate post number since 2019.

S4: Fantastic. Well, this is the moment in this episode where I remind everybody that while this bridge episode is available to all hit parade subscribers, we only open our trivia rounds to Slate Plus members. So if you are a member and would like to be a trivia contestant, visit slate.com. Slash hit parade. Sign up. That’s Slate.com. Slash hit parade. Sign up. So Josh, you probably know how this works, but we’re going to ask you three trivia questions. The first will be a callback to last month’s full length episode of Hit Parade. And the next two will be a preview of the forthcoming hit parade episode. Also, one little wrinkle this month. The second question is going to be both a throwback to our last episode and a preview. Not something we normally do, but just throwing that in there to give you a little hint. Are you ready for some trivia, Josh? I think so. Here we go. Question one.

ADVERTISEMENT

S17: Last month we talked not only about hot 100 holiday hits, but also the record setting chart history of Mariah Carey. One record she still holds is launching a career with the most number one songs. Which of these was not one of those five chart toppers? A Vision of Love. B, emotions. C, I don’t want to cry. Or D, can’t let go.

S20: Since she had so many. I think it was these and that is correct.

S21: The correct answer is D.

S1: Can’t let go when it peaked at number two in January 1992. It ended karey streak of five number ones, which also included the three other songs you heard plus. Love Takes Time. And someday, of course, Carrie would go on to score 14 more chart toppers over the next twenty seven years. By the way, Rich, while we’re talking about these Mariah hits, I have to say that Can’t Let Go, which peaked at number two, is actually one of my favorite Mariah Carey hits.

S14: It had that kind of whispery vocal that you were talking about a little bit. I don’t know. I just I thought it was an exceptional record at the time.

S11: Yeah, I love it, too. I think it’s. It kind of does the R&B quiet storm thing in a way that she hadn’t really done at that point. It’s just more sort of straightforwardly R&B that it is this sort of multi veiling pop, R&B, AC kind of soupy stuff she was doing on the first record.

S22: And if I had to pick from that list, I would have let that song go to number one and knock off. I Don’t Want to Cry, which is a song I never totally, totally agree.

ADVERTISEMENT

S17: You’re one for one, Josh.. Are you ready for question two? Let’s do it. All right. Like I said, this is kind of a hybrid question. It is both a callback and a preview. Question two in last month’s episode. I also took a break from discussing Christmas songs to talk about novelty songs, which were huge on the charts decades ago. Which of these comical novelty hits did not top the hot 100 between the 1950s and the 1970s? And David Seville, the Witchdoctor B Bobby Boris Pickett, The Monster MASH. C, Napoleon the 14th. They’re coming to take me away. Ha ha. Or D Ray Stevens, the streak.

S20: I really have no idea.

S4: I’m going to guess the I’m sorry, the correct answer was C. They’re coming to take me away.

S14: Ha ha. Coming to take me away. Coming to take me away.

S2: Singer songwriter Jerry Samuels issued this manic hit under the name Napoleon the 14th in 1966 and saw it reach number three on the hot 100 that summer.

S4: The other three hits all reached number one in 1958, 1962 and 1974, respectively. All right. No worries there, Josh.. We’ve got one more question for you. Are you ready for question three? Let’s try. OK. What two hits which peaked at number one and number two on the hot 100 in the same week in the early 80s were coincidentally both parodied by novelty superstar Weird Al Yankovic and became two of his earliest hot 100 hits.

S17: A I love rock and roll and Mickey B Beat It and Jeopardy! C My Sharona and another one bites the dust. Or D like a virgin and king of pain.

S20: I’m going to get C I’m sorry.

ADVERTISEMENT

S17: The correct answer was B. Beat it. And Jeopardy! These songs by Michael Jackson and Greg Kinne, respectively, pieced together in the top two slots in May 1983.

S2: One year later, Weird Al recorded them as Eat It and I lost on Jeopardy respectively.

S4: And they were both hot 100 hits in 1984. By the way, all eight of these songs I listed in this question were parodied by Al and were Billboard chart hits. All right, Josh.. You went one for three. You got the Mariah question. Nicely done. I understand you have a trivia question for me.

S18: Yeah, I sure do. Here we go, Chris. All right. In October nineteen seventy six. What a novelty song by Memphis radio deejay Rick D was in the Billboard Hot 100 for 10 weeks, peaking at number one.

S23: Is it a groove gorilla B, disco duck. C, funky kong. or D, boogie bullfrog?

S21: Well, how could I forget this one? It’s actually even played in the movie Saturday Night Fever, which came out a year later. And that, of course, would be the Rick D hit disco duck.

S19: And you’re right. The answer is B, disco.

S24: The. And you were also correct that it was included in the movie Saturday Night Fever, although records management decided now to allow the song on the movie soundtrack, fearing it would compete with his own sales.

S9: Boy, what a mistake that was right. Awful man. Because you think about the artists who kind of got floated along on that Saturday Night Fever soundtrack like, you know, Kool and the Gang had open sesame on that on that album and every time it sold. Right. Exactly. Tavares. Tavares. They all made back off that soundtrack. Yeah. Being featured on a movie soundtrack is one way to make a fortune. So Not a Smart Move by Rick D. But you know, he’s got his radio fortune, so I’m sure he’s not sweating it too much. Well, Josh, thank you for giving me a trivia question I could get. I appreciate that. It’s been a few months since I’ve gotten a question. Correct. So I am holding my head up high. And you at least got one of our three. Correct. So I hope your holding your head up high as well.

S18: Absolutely. Glad it could be a part of this.

S4: Thanks so much, Josh..

S7: So as indicated by our trivia round, the next hit parade episode, which will build off of our most recent full-length separate episode, is going to be about comedy and novelty hits on the Billboard charts. You know, I’m using the novelty hits of 1958 as a jumping off point to talk about these goofy chart hits which really were much bigger in the early rock era than they are now. It’s hard to build a career as a novelty recording artist. Some have tried, but there have been many one offs folks who have succeeded briefly and then never been heard from again. However, we’re going to talk about at least one person who managed to make a whole career as a novelty recording artist. I think it’s pretty obvious who that is. And in a way, the history of novelty hits on the charts tracks some of the same changes in chart methodologies that Christmas hits. Leverage to become bigger and bigger hit so much the way Christmas hits had to wait for digital technology to change the way we measure hit novelty recording hits are starting to come back on the charts because of technology. So we’re going to talk about that in the next episode of Hit Parade. My thanks to Rich as we act for joining me on this episode of The Bridge. And Rich, tell us where folks can find you.

S10: Well, I guess you could go to my Twitter. That would probably be the easiest, most centralized point. RISC h jayyousi. Fantastic.

S2: My thanks to Àsia solution for not only joining me, but also producing this episode of Hit Parade the Bridge. Keep on marching on the one.
