S1: He hit parade listeners a couple of quick announcements, we’ve got an unusual schedule for August, essentially we’re giving you two special bridge episodes this month. Today’s show is a recording of last week’s installment of Slate’s Wednesday Night Live, which was a live hit parade trivia, Ed.. I was the host and I got to quiz several Slate luminaries on Billboard chart brainteasers. We had a blast then later this month in the place where we would normally bring you a full length story, we’ll instead be doing a supersized edition of our regular hit parade. The bridge show will be following up last month’s yacht rock episode with some very special guests. You won’t want to miss it. Now, without further ado, enjoy our live hit parade trivia showdown.

S3: Hi, everybody, this is Chris Malathy, host of Hit Parade, and welcome to Slate’s Wednesday Night Live.

S4: This is our extra special hit parade trivia competition with some of my friends here at Slate. We’re going to give them all some trivia challenges tonight. And then at the end of each round, they’re going to turn the tables on me. So it’s going to be a very exciting head to head competition. By sheer coincidence, our four contestants tonight all have names, starting with D. So to quote the old hip hop song, we’re throwing some D on it tonight. And our first contestant for our Slate trivia is Dana Stevens is Slate’s movie critic and co-host of The Slate Culture Gabfest. Dana, are you there?

S5: I’m here and I’m ready.

S4: All right. Thank you so much for agreeing to join us tonight. I heard you on the Culture Gabfest today talking about your anxiety, about doing some trivia. So are you ready to give it a go?

S5: I just have to say that I am the offspring. My father is a super trivia brain. He knows every Oscar that’s been awarded in the history of the Oscars. He knows all the presidents and all the vice presidents in order. He’s like a brain trivia guy and I did not inherit that at all, nor do I know anything about Pop. So I’m going to be the fall guy. But that’s OK.

S4: All right. Well, we’re letting you take the first round. Your category for round one is 80s hits.

S6: Let’s go to question one. What interrogative Latin flavored Madonna song hit number one, but was left off her 1990 immaculate collection compilation. A, Express yourself. B, where’s the part C, Wladyslaw, Bonita or D, who’s that girl?

S5: OK, well, I’m leaving out the two that are not interrogative in any way and their titles. Maybe that’s a mistake, but because it’s the song that I hear about less and would not have come to mind immediately, I’m going to go with B, where’s the party.

S7: I’m sorry. The correct answer was D, who’s that girl? Though it topped the hot one hundred in the summer of nineteen eighty seven. This hit from B Flop Madonna movie of the same name was left off of Maja’s first greatest hits TV. It would not appear on a Madonna compilation until 2009.

S4: All right. For one, you win with a fifty fifty on interrogative. That was very logical. Let’s see how you do with question two. Are you ready for question two?

S5: If I can’t get a Gen X song, I’m completely screwed. But go ahead.

S6: OK, here we go. Question two. What song by a musician slash TV star was number one on the hot one hundred when MTV launched this week in August 1981. A Rick Springfield, Jessie’s Girl Be Dolly Parton nine to five see Kim Carnes, Bette Davis Eyes or D. Christopher Cross Arthur’s theme. Best that you can do.

S5: That’s brutal. Totally brutal, because I happen to know that the movie was released in nineteen eighty one and I’m not sure about the rest of those. I am going to say Arthur’s theme. Christopher Cross Letter D.

S7: I am sorry. The correct answer is a Jessie’s girl.

S3: When it hit number one, Rick Springfield was starring as Dr. Noah Drake on General Hospital. He got more TV exposure from the soap opera than from MTV at first when it launched on August 1st, 1981, the video channel didn’t play Jessie’s girl in its first 24 hours.

S4: I’m so sorry, Dana. You you have one more chance to redeem yourself. Are you ready for question three? The final question in your round? Yeah. All right. Here we go.

S6: Question three in which Talking Heads song their only top 10 pop hit. Does David Byrne declare I’m an ordinary guy a once in a lifetime. B and she was C burning down the house or D road to nowhere.

S5: I don’t even quit. The trick is figuring out which one of these went to number one or went to the top ten. And I’m going to say D Road to nowhere.

S7: I am so sorry I told you the correct answer is C burning down the house. Oh yeah.

S3: The lead single from Talking Heads nineteen eighty three album Speaking in Tongues album peaked at number nine on the hot one hundred in October 1983.

S4: Oh gosh Diana I’m so sorry.

S5: I thought at least my test taking skills would give me one. But no I mean just like flipping a coin would have been better.

S4: Well now you get to hang back and watch your fellow contestants squirm and ask you my question when the time comes.

S6: That’s right. Yes. I apologize. It is time for you to go right now. Revenge on me and turn the tables on me. Yes. How can I forget?

ADVERTISEMENT

S5: Yes, I will say. I knew that I was going to bomb on and answering questions, but I think I have a good question for you. I’m not saying is unanswerable, but I’m proud of its construction because I learned something in researching it. So, OK, because I’m the movie critic and I know a lot more about movies than music. I’m going to ask you a sort of movie related question. And it has to do with the phenomenon of songs that have won the best original song, Oscar, and also hit number one on the Billboard Hot 100. Right, which is a pretty rare phenomenon. In most of the years the Oscar has existed. It didn’t happen at all until 1969 with Raindrops Keep Falling On My Head from Butch Cassidy the most recent time it happened, which I’m sure lots of listeners even I could get. This is a star is born shallow, right on 19. But this is about the 80s, the phenomenon in the 80s, which happened to be the best decade ever for this to happen, for something to hit the Billboard Top 100, No. One in the in the hot 100 and also win an Oscar. OK, that happened seven out of the ten years between 1980 and 1989. So my question for you, let me make sure that I have it phrased correctly. Actually, one of them was that was the song you just mentioned, Arthur’s theme that won the double both the Yes. The Oscar and hitting number one. But my question is this. Two of the songs that won best original song in the 1980s were performed by the same artist. And both of these songs were hits in the top five. OK, so that’s that’s your your background information. OK, who is that artist? What were the two songs and which one of the two reached number one in the Billboard Hot 100.

ADVERTISEMENT

S6: So one was went to number one and one went top five. Let’s see. And they both they and let me get the straight one. When they both went either top five or number one in the 80s.

S5: In the 80s. Yes. For the movie that they won, they won the Oscar for the Oscar for Best Original song. And I’m going to give you one other tiny hint, which is that they were not only both sung by the same person, but both co-written by the same person as well.

S6: OK. I think I know I think the person who sang them is Irene Cara, and I think the songs are fame, which one for 1980 and Flashdance. What a feeling. Which one for 1983.

S8: That is correct. So which one of them hit number one. Flashdance. What a feeling. Hit number one. Yeah. Oh my God. Was that easy?

S3: Did you even experience a slight moment of challenge? I, I absolutely did actually. I had a moment of panic when I realized I was going to have to start running the Oscar winners through my head. And then when I hit on Irene Cara, I went, oh, right. You won for fame. So then I think she maybe you’d have to go through Oscar history for the industry for this. But I suspect that she must be the only vocalist who sung two songs that have won best original song. Oscar would be listeners can write in. If that’s not true, that’s a great question because Barbra Streisand sang at least one and possibly two. She sang the way we were.

S6: And I think Evergreen from her version of A Star is Born. I think that won the Oscar. I would need to double check that.

ADVERTISEMENT

S5: So it’s possible there’s been more than one, but it may be a two for Irene and Barbara. All right. Still, I like my question.

S4: It’s an excellent question. Certainly that was a really challenging question. And Dana, thank you for being on our Wednesday Night Live trivia. It’s a pleasure. So now I think it’s time for me to bring up contestant number two, our second D, and that is Dan Kois. Dan Course is an editor and co-host of Mom and Dad are Fighting. And he is he came to play, apparently Dan Motherfucker.

S9: I knew all three of Dana’s questions and I’m going to get like 50s doo wop or some shit.

S4: You’re not getting 50s doowop, I can tell you right now.

S9: Cheddar to be on the show. Long time listener, first time caller.

S4: Cheers. And let’s I should take a sip. I shouldn’t toast and not take a sit down toast and not take a sip.

S10: That’s bad luck for me.

S6: That’s bad luck for both of us. All right. Let’s reveal your category, which is hip hop. All right. And here is question one. What wild, funky performer scored the first number one album by a rap soloist, a L.L. Cool J, B, Tone LOC, C, M.C. Hammer or D, Vanilla Ice?

S9: It’s a great question. All four of those guys were both wild and funky. That you put those in quotes suggest that they are related, but that is a name that one of them gave himself. C. No. One albums by rap solo, as I know that it took a while for albums to peak on the charts. So I’m going to go with C M.C. Hammer.

ADVERTISEMENT

S3: I’m sorry. The correct answer is B Tone LOC. When his album looked after Dark containing the hits Wild Thing and Funky Cold, Medina topped the chart in April 1989. It became only the second rap LP ever to hit number one and the first by a solo rapper. After the Beastie Boys licensed to Ill In. I thought about the singles should have thought about the singles you’ve got now is one. That was the hint of the hint. Yeah. All right. For one, let’s see if you can redeem yourself on question too. Shall we go to question two.

S6: Yeah. How do you want it became too POCs only number one single in nineteen ninety six. But what was its much better known beside a keep your head up. B Dear Mama C California love or D changes.

S9: This is also tough because I would have guessed not knowing that both California love and changes were both number one singles. So I feel strongly he’s got to be one of those, but I’m probably even wrong about that. I’m going to go with changes d sun.

S3: I am sorry. The correct answer was indeed c California love perhaps lead off track on death row records was out for months and a radio hit before it was finally issued on a CD single with How do you want the so-called two sided hit top the hot one hundred. But how was track one and thus the side. Oh man, you were so close I really thought you had it so.

S6: All right, we got one more in this category. I got this one in the back. Pulled it out. All right, here we go. Question three. What Missy Elliott hit couldn’t reverse places with Eminem’s Lose Yourself and spent ten weeks stuck at number two on the hot 100. A, it b, get your freak on. C, the rain superduper fly or D, hop boys.

ADVERTISEMENT

S9: The answer to this, obviously, as America’s greatest and most problematic karaoke song, a circuit that is correct.

S8: The correct answer is a working Missy’s biggest hit in which she, quote, put her thang down, flipped it and reversed it for a minute. Best one.

S3: Yep, yep, yep, yep. Exactly. So it’s not one hundred record for most weeks at number two without reaching No. One. It’s tied, by the way, with another ten week. No. Two foreigners, nineteen eighty one hit waiting for a girl like you which got stuck behind Olivia Newton John’s physical.

S9: I did. You got one. I know. And very upset with myself. But let’s see, let’s see if I can beat anyone.

S4: All right. Well, and before we get to that, you get to have your revenge on me and ask me a question.

S9: Yeah, this is a good one. This is I believe I actually have a slide for you. This is about the beloved tradition of pop artists recording bill. We’re recording classical crossover albums, albums that fulfill their dreams of being classical composers and or performers. So the question is XML Malathy, please match the pop or rock artist to the title of their top ten album on the Billboard classical charts. The five artists are one. Billy Joel two, Elvis Costello, three, Paul McCartney for Sting and five Michael Bolton. The titles of the five albums are A Fantasies and Delusions Be My Secret Passion. The Arias See Songs from the Labyrinth, D Standing Stone and E Il Song, y’all.

S6: Wow. OK, one of these I can knock off immediately because as Hit Parade listeners know, in April I did an episode about Billy Joel and I happen to know and I talked about in the episode that his classical album was a fantasies and delusions. I happen to know that three Paul. Hartney did die standing stone, so that’s to me, I’m pretty sure that five Michael Bolton, because this is such a Michael Bolton title, did be my secret passion, the Arias. And that leaves Elvis Costello and Sting. I can’t tie Ellson you to anybody, but I’m pretty sure that Sting did see songs from The Labyrinth, which means by process of elimination, Elvis Costello did e Ellson, you motherfucker.

ADVERTISEMENT

S9: You got it right. Yeah, that is correct. Michael Bolton did do the very Bolton ask my secret passion.

S10: The Arias, one of Elvis Costello’s three classical tinged albums. Ilze L is ill Suneo His first was of course the Juliet letters, which he did with the Brodsky Quartet. One of Paul McCartney’s three classical albums was standing so and I did not ask you about the obvious one. The Liverpool or oratorio Sting did indeed do songs on the Labyrinth and Billy Joel of course did fantasies, fantasies and illusions. My favorite thing about that album is, of course, that up in the upper left hand corner of the album cover, it says Joel Opus one. His had just the beginning of his long and prosperous classical career to be studied by historians for decades.

S3: Yes, 19 years later, it still has on the classical. That’s right. Still Opus one through 10, but no further by.

S2: Thank you, Chris. Thank you, Don, that was fantastic. That was a seriously excellent question and I appreciate the visual aid as well. All right, we’re going to move on to contestant number three, let’s see if she can do better than Dan. And contestant three is Danielle Hewitt, who is a producer for What Next? Slate’s Daily News Show and an old friend of Hit Parade because she helped us out with many an episode. Hi, Danielle. Hi, Chris.

S11: Happy to be on the other end of trivia.

S4: Yeah, no, it’s great to have you. All right. So are you ready to take this on?

S11: Ready as I’ll ever be.

S2: Your category is alternative rock. Oh, man. All right. And let’s move to question one. Which of these moody U.K. alt rock bands was the first to score a US Top 40 hit in 1985 with people are people a new order, B, the Smiths, C, The Cure, or D, Depeche Mode?

ADVERTISEMENT

S11: OK, I’m going to be extremely honest and I have no idea. I’m truly going to guess. And I’ve been told I’ve heard that C is always the best answer. So I’m going to say C the cure. Yeah, I’m sorry.

S3: The correct answer was D, Depeche Mode. There people are people reached number 13 on the hot 100 in August 1985, two years before New Order crack the US Top 40 with true faith. And the cure broke through with just like heaven. The Smiths never scored an American top 40. All right. Tough one for one. Let’s see how you do with question number two. Ready for to do it.

S2: All right. RTM scored for top ten pop hits, but which was their biggest peaking at number four on the hot 100 in 1991. A the one I love. B, stand C, losing my religion or D, shiny, happy people.

S11: I’m going to say C again, losing my religion.

S8: And that is correct.

S3: The correct answer is C, losing my religion, the one I love hit number nine in nineteen eighty seven, stand to reach number six in 1989 and in nineteen ninety one shiny happy people who follow up to losing my religion hit number ten. Excellent. You’re one for two. Ready for question three. It.

S2: All right. Here we go. What nineteen ninety five album was the top selling rock CD of the 90s, going 16 times platinum and later became a Broadway musical, a Hootie and the Blowfish cracked rear view be no doubt tragic kingdom see jewel pieces of You or D. Alanis Morissette Jagged Little Pill.

S11: OK, this is like the exact intersection of my interests, I’m going to regret saying that if I got this wrong, but I think it’s a lot of stories, that jagged little pill.

ADVERTISEMENT

S8: That is correct. The correct answer is jagged little pill. All four albums went diamond for 10 million or more in sales. And the Hoodie album eventually equaled L.A. in 16 times platinum s sales. But only Jagged Little Pill was turned into a musical which reached Broadway in twenty nineteen.

S2: Fantastic. You are our leader so far too. Fact that so I understand. Now you have a question for me.

S11: Yeah. All right. This is also having to do with Alternative Rock. The week of February 3rd, 2007, the rock band Follow Boy enjoyed its highest ever position on the Billboard Hot 100, which followed by a single sat at number two on the chart just behind Beyonce’s irreplaceable. At number number one, a sugar. We’re going down. B, thanks for the memories. C, dance, dance or D, this ain’t a scene. It’s an arms race.

S2: Counterintuitively, because I don’t think it was a big radio hit, I think it’s really well, their biggest speaking hit, the number to hit, was did this same a scene?

S6: It’s an arms race.

S11: Yeah, you’re right. That’s crazy that you got that right. I truly do not. Anyway, yeah. So the answer is D all of those songs made it to the top ten except for thanks for the memories which peaked at number 11, which is wild. I love that song. Yeah. It’s like the one that everyone remembers next to like dance dance and actually they’re all pretty remember memorable. But thanks to the memories of the most memorable ones. The one the piece number. Yeah. Like I know that song, but like I would not expect a casual fan to know that song says.

ADVERTISEMENT

S2: All right, that will be a great question. Thank you, Danielle. Stick around, because so far you are the points leader among our contestants. So you’re almost definitely I think there’s no question that you’re definitely going to our bonus. Wow. So great loose because there’s more to come. All right. And that brings our fourth and final contestant into the arena. And that is Derrick Johnson, who is a designer at Slate. Derrick, are you there? Sorry, I had to meet on Enviga. That’s quite all right. All right. Let’s see what your category is. Dance and disco. All right. And let’s move right into question number one. What electro disco song? A number six hit in 1977 made Brian Eno say, I’ve heard the future to David Bowie, a Kraftwerk Trans Europe Express B Donna Summer. I feel love. See em pop music or D, Gary Numan cars.

S12: I’m going to go with craftwork on this one craftwork.

S3: Hey, I’m sorry, the correct answer is B, I feel love. The Donna Summer single co-written with producers Giorgio Moroder and Pete Belotti, was the first chart hit with all synthesized instrumentation. Brian Eno called it a watershed that would change the sound of club music, which it did.

S2: All right. For one, let’s see how you do with question two. Are you ready for question two? I think so. Of All right, here we go. Which BJ’s song was on the Saturday Night Fever soundtrack, but hit number one in 1976, a year before the film. A, You should be dancing be. How deep is your love see Stayin Alive or D, Night Fever.

S13: OK, I’m going to take a guess here. I know all first off, let’s say Night Fever D I’m sorry.

S2: The correct answer is A..

ADVERTISEMENT

S3: You should be dancing. John Travolta’s Tony Manero does indeed dance to this chart topper in the movie. But it was from the BJ’s prior album, Children of the World.

S2: The other three tracks made their debut on the Fever soundtrack, and all of them hit number one. All right. We’ve got one more for you. Your chance to redeem it and maybe go to the final round. Are you ready for question three now? Let’s go. All right, cool. What’s number one dance song? The top hot 100 hit of 1999 popularized ostentatious auto tune on pop vocals, a Britney Spears baby one more time. B, Faith Hill, the way you love me, see Cher Believe or D, Jennifer Lopez. If you had my love.

S13: And this one, I know it’s Saveliev, for sure. Let see.

S3: That is correct. The correct answer is C believe producer Mark Taylor’s pioneering use of Autotuning to make Cher sound robotic. She told her label, Remove it over. My dead body was imitated across pop, rap and even country. Faith Hill’s top 10 hit The Way You Love Me, also included Auto tuned in its chorus.

S2: All right, so you got one out of three, right, which ties you with Dan? We’re going to have to do a tiebreaker round to see who goes on to the final category. But before we do that, I think you have a turning the table question for me.

S13: I do. How you and your these days.

S2: Oh, man. Depends. It really depends. But OK.

S13: OK, here we go. Of the following four foundational solo albums by members of the Wu Tang Clan, which are the highest on the Billboard 200 album chart, is a Raekwon only Bill four Cuban Linx B, Ghostface Killah Man, C, Jizya Liquid Swords. Or is it the ol dirty bastard returns to the 36 chambers.

ADVERTISEMENT

S2: Which one are the highest on the about 200 see, the hard part is I’m pretty sure none of those hit number one. So I’ve got to now figure out which one went the highest, Shiza. And you didn’t ask for Method Man, I was looking for a Method man hoping that because I’m pretty sure he went to number two with his album. I think I may be stumped on this one. I know I’m going to go with Raekwon only built four Cuban Linx.

S12: I feel I feel so good right now.

S14: OK, yeah, the answer is B I am Man by Ghostface Killah, which peaked at number two in nineteen ninety six. Fun fact. The other three albums all came out in ninety five this year. That’s the twenty fifth anniversary. This is a question for you, but I’m like super into looting and it’s like a it’s a big year though. The other three came out when ninety five Raekwon peaked at number four, peaked at number seven and the Giuseppe’s at number nine. I met with that number two.

S2: All right. You stumped me. Well done. So I got my comeuppance. Finally, the relatives. I deserve that. You were close. You’re close and I was close. I got the second highest. So. All right. We I think correct me if I’m wrong, we need to do a tiebreaker now.

S9: Yeah, we need to do a tiebreaker.

S2: Yeah, we do. To see who goes on to the bonus round. Hey, I don’t in my set. So I’m pulling up my I’m pulling up my my if I can find them. Hang on just one second. We did prepare for this eventuality Derek.

S9: My feeling is we both got fucked on categories.

S12: We did. Yeah.

ADVERTISEMENT

S9: I’m just saying I knew all the data and I knew all of Danielle’s.

S13: I knew all year. Yeah.

S2: It’s almost like they planned it this way. It’s almost like that. You would think that. All right. So here’s our tiebreaker question. And the good news is you guys don’t have to, like, buzz in or answer faster because basically it’s going to be whoever comes the closest. So here we go. This is the question as close as possible and including Skitz and bonus tracks. How many tracks are on Lauryn Hill’s nineteen ninety eight album, The Miseducation of Lauryn Hill? Either one of you can answer for us.

S9: I’ll answer first. I’m going to answer eighteen. Okay.

S12: Derek, how many skits were on the album?

S9: How many tracks? How many total tracks?

S13: Oh, I’m sorry. I missed the whole question of the whole the entire thing.

S9: Yeah, no, no. I mean, how many kids how many skits on the album, Derrick?

S12: 15.

S2: The winner is Derek, because the correct answer is 16 for Nicholas. Interestingly, there’s only one set that’s given its own track on the album, which is the intro, and all the other sets are woven into the tracks.

S10: So that’s what got me. I forgot that every other skit is just the last minute and forty five seconds of average chock-a-block.

S4: Exactly. So, Derek, you not only stumped me, you go on to our bonus round.

S10: So congratulate earned it. He earned it. I couldn’t stop it.

S2: All right. So now this is exciting. We’re going to go on to our head to head bonus round. And I think we need to bring back Danielle, who is our two question winner. And there she is. Hi. All right. So now I think for this. Correct me if I’m wrong, faith in Asia, we need a buzzer noise from one of you so that can be whatever you like, whoever whoever answers first can get the question or if you miss it, the other person can steal. And like before the round has three questions. The final round category is simply called Chart Pery in jeopardy. It’s just a general chart, nerdy questions. So here we go. Here comes question one, please. Buzz in the Beatles, hold the record for most hot one hundred number one hits with twenty who is second scoring a nineteenth number one hit just last year. A Reanna B Mariah Carey. C, Beyonce or D Drake. Derek, what do you got is a drink?

S11: Yeah, I’m going to say Mariah Carey.

S8: That is correct.

ADVERTISEMENT

S3: The correct answer is Mariah Carey. She scored her first number one on the Hot 100 in 1990 with Vision of Love and her 19th to date last December with All I Want for Christmas is you. Of the other three choices, Rihanna has the most chart toppers with 14.

S2: All right. One for Danielle. Let’s move on to question two. Here we go. What album sold the most copies in a week debuting atop the Billboard album chart with three point three eight million in sales. A, Adele, twenty five, B, Taylor Swift, nineteen eighty nine, C, N Sync, no strings attached. Or D, Britney Spears. Oops, I did it again.

S15: Oh, no questions revealed.

S2: Oh, no. So let’s OK, Sean, I guess now that we’ve revealed what the answer is, shall I shall I read the full answer? Sure. OK. All right.

S3: I’m going to read the full answer. The correct answer was a 25 when it opened in November 2015 to more than three million in its first week. Adele’s third album beat a record held for 15 years by the boy band In-Sync, whose 2000 album had sold two point four million in its first week. The Swift and Spears albums each opened to approximately one point three million.

S2: All right, nobody gets that one. So this is interesting because our little accident, we’re going to go to question three. We’ll see who gets it if we wind up in a tie. I actually have more tie breaker questions so we can actually solve this conundrum. So why don’t we move on to question three, ask what artist built a 30 year streak of US top 40 hits, scoring at least one every year between 1970 and nineteen ninety nine, A, Paul McCartney, B, Elton John, C, Diana Ross, or D, Michael Jackson. OK, I’m going to buzz in. OK, Michael will do. I am. I am sorry. That is incorrect. Derek, you can steal.

ADVERTISEMENT

S13: Oh I’m going to go Paul McCartney. Hey, I’m sorry.

S2: That was also incorrect. The correct answer is B Elton John starting with 1970s.

S3: Your song, The Joe DiMaggio of the Hot 100 had at least one single in the top 40 at least one week of each year through 1999, when his LeAnn Rimes duet written in The Stars reached number 29.

S2: I think that that makes our ultimate winner with one out of our three questions notwithstanding our accident. Daniel Furat, Daniel Preparation. I see you’re both winners because, of course, Derek was the only one who stumped me. So I think you guys walk away with a serious moral victory here tonight.

S15: Yeah. Shared bragging rights, I think. I think that’s right. I’m truly sorry that I beat Derek. Well, I’m sorry about the tough categories.

S4: You guys were really game. I’d like to thank both of you. I’d like to thank Dana and Dan who brought their A game as well. And I’d like to thank everybody for tuning in to this special trivia edition of Hit Parade for Wednesday Night Live Slate. I’m Chris Melaniphy. And as we say on Hit Parade. Keep on marching on the one.
