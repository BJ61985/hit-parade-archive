S1: Hey, everybody, this is Chris, M.A., host of Hit Parade, Slate’s podcast of Pop Chart History. Welcome to the Bridge.

S2: That’s the original 1962 version of Oh Yeah comb-over by the King of Latin Music, Dito pointing a man whose last name pointed in Spanish literally means bridge. A native of New York City, where we are recording today’s live edition of Hit Parade. The bridge point day was known also as the King of the Timbales. Oh yeah. Como Ra. His best known composition, which translates roughly to Listen How It Goes, has been recorded by dozens of musicians, including Carlos Santana, who took it to number 13 in 1971. National Public Radio later named Oh Yeah, comb-over, one of the most important musical works of the 20th century. And these mini episodes, bridge are full length monthly episodes. Give us a chance to catch up with listeners and enjoy some hit parade trivia this month. I am delighted to be joined by Eduardo Cepeda, a Mexican-American writer and the music editor at the Latin media site or a Mascola. Eduardo spent years as a touring musician and deejay and eventually founded Mother of Pearl, a record store that went on to become a label, a music festival and a marketing agency. He splits his time between Brooklyn and Brooklyn and has a five year old who loves dancing to La Romana. Eduardo Scarpetta, welcome to the bridge. It’s a pleasure to have you. You know, obviously, we’re here to talk about the most recent episode, a full length episode of Hit Parade, which was all about the history of Latin pop crossover on the American charts. And I wanted to ask a personal question, for starters, are growing up. Did you consider Spanish language music part of your regular music diet or were Anglo pop and Latin pop separate worlds for you?

S3: They were both essentially because growing up as as a first generation immigrant, right. Like you’re kind of trying to fit in. You’re kind of trying to do whatever your friends are doing. So I was listening to, you know, grunge was a sinister nirvana or whatever. But then at home, you know, I would hang out with my dad who played congas and boehnke bongos and stuff. And so we would listen like a lot of salsa and stuff like that and play along with that. And so they were both part of my daily life, but they were separate from each other for a really long time.

S2: Right. And that’s interesting. vis-a-vis the topic of the podcast episode because I was trying to pinpoint the moment when these worlds, at least on the charts, started to merge in the 20th century. Songs like Guantanamera and oh yeah, come over became standards and they resonated with Anglo audiences. Why do you think that was?

S3: Well I think on one hand it’s because they were just very popular, very catchy songs that played on various, you know, maybe commercials or movies or just became a part of pop culture. But also, I think they were easily accessible to non-Latino audiences. And I think maybe I’m getting ahead of myself here, but that’s how that crossover ended up happening, because maybe a lot of songwriters kind of understood what Anglo audiences would consume and integrated that into their songwriting for a bigger pop stars to kind of create this crossover thing that happened at the turn of the century.

S2: Right. And how do you perceive 20th century crossover? And I guess what’s the moment for you where this crossover passes from the world of novelty to something a little more legitimate?

S4: Well, I guess when, you know, Ricky Martin was on the charts and it was a great moment in and of itself, but it was very treated, a tokenized movement almost. So it was great to in one on one hand, it was great to see these artists resonating with Anglo audiences. But on the other hand, they were doing it in a way that was very playing to Anglo audiences rather than being authentic itself. Right. And so at the time, I thought it was kind of cheesy.

S3: Now, in retrospect, I almost think, well, there was no other way at the moment to do it right. That was the way to kind of start opening the door for bad bunnies and Cardi B’s to kind of just do themselves how they want to do it. Right. So it was an important moment, albeit a very complicated right.

S2: And so I would imagine as a fan of Latin music yourself, watching those worlds collide, yet in this kind of watered down way must have been a little surreal for you. Right. As a fan of both sides of the radio dial, so to speak.

S3: Right. I mean, it was it was especially at the time. I mean, we didn’t take it like men. Listen, my group of friends. Right. We didn’t take it very seriously. Oh, actually, I was a fan of Shakira before she quote unquote, crossed over. And the sound she was performing back then was very different from what she ended up doing to kind of reach Anglo audiences. She was doing very kind of almost basic, but catchy alt rock and then in the late 90s. And so actually saw her on that very first tour. She only played for 40 minutes because she didn’t have that many songs. So when she came out with these huge stage set ups and, you know, the dancing cobra that she had on stage, that was just like, what is going on here?

ADVERTISEMENT

S2: You know, it was definitely a big pivot, I guess, because it was like she was defining her own crossover, right? It was she was crossing over. But it was it was kind of almost in the other direction, taking the parts of American rock she wanted and fusing it to her own thing.

S3: Right. Definitely. And yeah, even if you look at her early stuff, she wasn’t doing technically Latin music. All she was doing was American rock music and Spanish, basically. Right. And so in a sense, when she again, crossover, which is a term I kind of don’t like, but it’s it’s a necessary term. She was adding it. She was incorporating more Latin elements. Right. So and especially some of her Arabic elements to it. We forget about that. She’s also Lebanese.

S2: So we’ve already touched on this a bit. But what I’m calling the version1.0 Latin boom of 99 to 2001. Were you excited, dismayed, confused by what Ricky Martin and J-Lo and Enrique all did during that period?

S3: Probably all of it. You know, again, it was it was it didn’t sound like the Latin music that a lot of Latino communities were listening to at the time, even though people Latinos did get into them to give us, as did get into Ricky Martin, did get into Shakira, J-Lo. I would I would exclude J-Lo from that a little bit, because, you know, she wasn’t really playing those tropes so much, you know. Right.

S5: She was just making the kind of music, as you mentioned in the podcast, the kind of music you could have heard, Ashanti made you so totally. In a sense, she was kind of one of the first to do this kind of crossover thing without playing into certain tropes.

ADVERTISEMENT

S1: Right. It’s as if crossover was baked into what she was doing from the jump. It wasn’t like Ricky or Enrique, who has one thing first and then translated it over a period of singles. She just kind of jumped right in with both feet with Rodney Jerkins and, you know, murdering perfect seductions and went straight to hip hop pretty quickly.

S5: And then we have to do with the fact that she she was from the Bronx and out from Puerto Rico or from Colombia. You know, I mean.

S2: Right. Let’s talk about reggaeton, which becomes a force in the early 2000s that exists in the late ‘90s. But it really kind of takes over in the arts. Why do you think it translates across cultures and why is that Dembo rhythms so irresistible and so adaptable?

S3: Well, I think, first of all, if you look at where the Dembo rhythm came from. And and Dembo is a very you know, if you talk to one at some of the old school or get tone producers, they’ll tell you like Dumbo is one very specific rhythm that was used. And now it’s kind of used as a catchall term for what the record thone driving beat is. But it’s not technically Dembo that beat that rhythm process, all kinds of cultures. I mean, it comes from Africa. You hear an Afro beats, you hear it in Sokha, you hear it in dancehall. Still obviously came Dembo specifically came from dancehall. So it’s a very afro diasporic beat. Right. So it’s not just a thought. Right. What you see with it, I get thrown specifically is it came from Panama. A lot of Jamaican artists were sending records to their cousins in Panama and they started rapping in Spanish over it. And then eventually it became what was called underground in Puerto Rico. And they started adding, you know, maybe like the Marlins, they started adding bachata guitars to it. And that’s kind of when it became what we call it, like a done maybe like in the mid 90s or so. So it kind of took on a little bit more of a Latino identity in that moment.

ADVERTISEMENT

S2: Yeah. I would imagine at some point reggaeton became the sound that to your point, it wasn’t just the Dumbo rhythm. It kind of sprouted tendrils and went everywhere. Right. And I imagine that however long you’ve been writing about Latin music, reggaeton has probably been essential to, you know, if not a son, certainly a planet around which lots of moon’s orbit in Lambros like I would imagine.

S3: Yeah.

S5: And one of the one of the interesting things to see about that is if you look at the beginnings of reggaeton when it was still called underground, you have Daddy Yankee there from 1991 making recordings when he was 13 years old. And he’s on some of the first the most seminal get done or on recordings with Egypt lyoto. So you have someone who is there from the very beginning when it was being recorded in like Plato’s apartment and the best videos of someone who’s now still on top of the game, that you rarely see that in a genre where somebody helped found the genre and it’s still on top of it.

S2: That blew my mind. Yeah, when I was putting together the episode, realizing the depth of Dubai’s. You know, career, both before the breakthrough moment in the aughts and after the breakthrough moment, the fact that it’s 20, this is a good transition to our next topic. It’s 2016 17 and he’s still enough on top of the game that this is the guy that really sponsee reaches out to for despacito. Like this is not somebody who’s just kind of, you know, a Has-Been. He’s still topping the Latin charts routinely. So let’s talk about that moment. I mean, whatever we think of despacito, do you think that it helped bring about a permanent foothold for Latin pop in the mainstream?

ADVERTISEMENT

S3: Absolutely. And again, like you said, whatever you think of that song, it did. It did serve a purpose. Right. It opened the world’s eyes to an entire genre. People maybe hadn’t been paying attention. There was this misconception that reggaeton had died in the like 2009, 2010. It was a big misconception because the sales were still there. Just the media outlets stopped paying attention after a while. Right. And so kind of what despacito did was bring back the the spotlight to the genre.

S5: And then, for example, we had a column that domestic before actually work there. There was a history of like a torn up to conform. I don’t know if that call me would have done as well in a predecessor at the world when we put out this column a few months after this seat, though. You know, you had a huge hit and lose fancy. I spoke to him once and he he completely accepts that he’s not as I don’t know that he was fortunate to land in this world and be allowed in it for one song. But he recognizes that this was pop music with a with a light Dembo rhythm behind it and not necessarily break it down percent. I think that kind of self-awareness is cool to hear from someone like that.

S2: I’ve I’ve admired just as an aside, you know, when despacito was rampaging on the charts in 2017 and I myself wound up talking about it on some TV shows and things. Every time I saw interviews with falsies, he was wonderfully self-deprecating and self-aware and realized he was he had a tiger by the tail and he knew it was a moment and he was not letting it get ahead of him.

ADVERTISEMENT

S3: Exactly. And he and he you know, he said he’s not going to try to recreate that moment either. He writes pop ballads on guitar, and that’s what he done and that’s what he’s always done. And so he’s good at it and he knows what he’s good at. Exactly.

S2: So I really feel that it sounds like you agree that we’re living in a kind of Post-it Esposito world in terms of Latin crossover now. And it it it blows my mind, as I said in the podcast, how much less compromised crossover Latin music is now at the turn of the 20s than it was at the turn of the millennium. Who have you been watching? You know, Bad Bunny is the obvious touchstone. I talked about him in the episode, but other other folks that you’re watching in this this brave new world that.

S5: Yeah, definitely. And like, you know, first set price say that at this point, because of some of the charting we’ve seen with Khadi being Bradburn and Jay Ballard and some of the stuff we’re seeing with Bat Bunny, I don’t think it’s a crossover any more at this point. I think it’s just part of our fabric of what the demographics of this country make up and listened to. And so hopefully that’s open the door for some artists. You know, some of the artists I’m watching are a lot of Dominican Dembo artists, which is kind of to give a quick explainer to people as super sped up almost version Newdegate done. There’s artists like Equal Crazy Geiling number yet. They’re doing really amazing stuff out of out of the Dominican Republic. And obviously it alpha was kind of the biggest name out of that. So far there’s artists like the Keesha who is just doing like this, you know, Trap and Dembo sound out of Dominican Republic.

S3: There’s Nino Augustine from Panama, who’s someone everybody should be watching. Eladio Kariong, who’s also in Bad Barney’s label. And he’s actually the guy who in a sense, discovered bad Bonnie. They were all. He was working with the prima as the record label. And he knew bad buddy from college. And he introduced him to the label head at Ramos and said, hey, you should check out this kid.

S5: And then we have Bonino, huh? There’s definitely a healthy, healthy ecosystem of artists and sound quality. They’re just magnificent. And we should be keeping an eye on them.

S2: That’s fantastic. Well, Eduardo, I can’t thank you enough for joining us for this live episode of The Bridge and Out. Where’s the best place for folks to read your stuff?

S5: You know, I don’t write as much anymore now that I’m the editor. Sure. But read what we what I edit, which is unfamous that dot com. And of course, there’s my post stories on my Twitter, which is otherwise the submitter and. Great.

S2: Well, post links to that on the show page when this bridge episode posted to this group. Well, for now.

S6: Thank you, Eduardo, so, so much for being on hit parade, the bridge disaster.

S2: Now comes the moment in hit parade, the bridge where we do some trivia. And joining us from Atlanta, Georgia is Tina. Hi, Tina. How are you, Bob?

S7: I’m great. Thanks for having me.

S2: Oh, thanks so much for joining us. I hope you’re having better weather down there than I’m having in New York today.

S7: Last night was rough. Last night was rough. We were quarantined in the bathroom overnight with the tornado warnings, so. Right. But it worked fine. Everybody’s fine.

S2: OK, glad to hear it. And I also hear that speaking of our current coronavirus existence, that you have postponed a. And a musical event in your life until we are out of quarantine. Do you want to tell me about that?

S7: Yes, it was imposed upon by choice. It was postponed by Corona virus. But I was able to get tickets to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame induction ceremony this year, which is in my hometown of Cleveland. And my favorite band in the world, Depeche Mode, is being inducted. So I had to go.

S2: That’s awesome. I am a Depeche Mode found myself. I’ve seen them live a couple of times and I’m a Rock Hall voter and I got to vote for them this year. And I was thrilled when they made it in. So that’ll be exciting. Well, excellent. And I imagine that you are also a slate plus member. Is that right, Tina?

S7: Absolutely. Absolutely.

S2: Wonderful. Well, as I remind folks, every month we only open our trivia rounds to Slate plus members like Tina. So if you are a member and would like to be a trivia contestant, visit Slate dot com slash hit parade, sign up. That’s slate.com. Slash hit parade, sign up. All right. So, Tina, I think you know how this works. We’ve been doing this long enough. Going to ask you three questions. The first will be a callback to our last episode of Hit Parade. And the next two will be a preview of the next episode of Hit Parade. Are you ready for some trivia? I’m as ready as I’m going to be. Here we go. Question one last month I discussed Latin pop crossover hits from the early rock era songs that even Americans with no Latin heritage would recognize. Which of these Latin standards was not a hot one hundred hit between 1959 and 1971? A. The Girl from Ipanema. B One thought Armada. I like it like that. Or D? Oh yeah. comb-over.

ADVERTISEMENT

S8: That’s a good one. I. I like it, like that’s got to be one. I’m gonna save my down on that.

S9: I’m sorry. The correct answer was C.. I like it like that. 1967, a classic by Pete Rodriguez, was a regional hit in New York City, but not on the Hot 100.

S2: Only the covers in later decades by the blackout, All Stars and Cardi B with J Dalven and Bad Bunny became hot 100 hits. OK. That was a tough one. But we’re going to jump to our preview trivia question, too. These four albums all came out in 1983 and each one generated multiple top 40 hits on the Hot 100. However, which one generated the most hits? A Billy Joel, an innocent man b? Lionel Richie can’t slow down. See the police synchronicity or D? Cyndi Lauper. She’s so unusual.

S7: This is my era here, too. There’s a lot of pressure. I know they all had multiple top 40 hits. I want it to be the police. So I’m gonna go and see the police. Synchronicity.

S1: I’m sorry. Again, the correct answer was Billy Joel an innocent man? Billy’s Aubagio, the music of his youth in the 50s and 60s, spun off a staggering six top 40 hits between late 1983 and early 1985. Richies and lappers albums generated five hits apiece and the polices generated for.

S2: All right, one more chance here. Are you ready for the third question? OK. Question 3 Billy Joel topped the hot 100. Three times in his career, but not always with the songs for which he is most famous. Three of these hits peaked at number three on the Hot 100, which was the only one to reach. Number one A. Just the way you are. Be my life. See? Tell her about it. Or D. Uptown girl.

S8: I am.

ADVERTISEMENT

S7: That’s tough basing this solely on the music video play that I remember. I’m going with D. Uptown girl.

S1: You are so close. But the answer is C.. Tell her about it. From the same album. She was the lead single from an innocent man and it topped the charts in the fall of 83. Joel’s follow up hit Uptown Girl spent more weeks on the chart but couldn’t get past number three, the same peak as just the way you are and my life.

S2: Well, I am so sorry, Tina, that we through such tough questions catch you every night. It was a perfect record, right? It is. It is. So now here’s your opportunity to turn the tables and ask me a trivia question. I understand you have something for me.

S7: I do. I do. So, you know, I’m 50 50. I hope we keep our perfect record going. But I also hope you get it right. Okay. All right. In the last episode, a hip raid. It was all about the Latin and Spanish artists that crossed over into the U.S. charts. So I wanted to sort of flip the crossover direction. OK. The Spanish music producers chart, which is the billboard equivalent in Spain, started in nineteen fifty nine. The results were based solely on retail music sales until January of 2015. So my question for you is what song was the first English language number one hit on the Spanish charts? Interesting. Was it a. Are You Lonesome Tonight by Elvis? He had a Hard Day’s Night by the Beatles. See Diana. By Paul Anka or D The Chipmunk Song by the Chipmunks with David Seville.

S8: Wow.

S2: I have a feeling it’s gonna be something quirky. First of all, I have no idea. So I’m guessing and I’m trying to use deductive logic. I’ll just admit that right up front. And something tells me it’s not gonna be something as obvious as the Beatles or Elvis necessarily. I think it’s gonna be something quirkier. I’m not sure I’m gonna go all the way to the Chipmunks, but why don’t we go with Diana by Paul Anka.

S7: Ding, ding, ding. You are correct. Wow.

ADVERTISEMENT

S1: It was Paul Anka and it was in May in the week of May 11th, 1959. So it wasn’t very long after the charts start.

S10: I’m sorry, George, this.

S1: I was gonna say that’s quite early. Right. And I think that’s even before Are You Lonesome Tonight by Elvis? If I’m not mistaken, cause I think that’s like a 1960 single.

S7: Yeah. Yes. Are you lonesome tonight? Topped the charts in 61. Hard Day’s Night in 64. And I just threw the Chipmunks in because of the white nerdy episode.

S2: Well, don’t we all love talking about the Chipmunks? I managed to get the Chipmunks into two consecutive episodes, the Christmas episode and the novelty hits episode. So I promise my listeners there’s not going to be any more chipmunk songs for a very long time. Well, Tina, thank you for giving me a question that I could puzzle my way through. I’m sorry that you didn’t get any of our questions right. But nonetheless, you took part in our Xoom Facebook live experiment. So I’m very glad you were here with us today. I hope you had fun.

S7: Thank you so much.

S1: For those of you who are listening, as you can probably tell from those trivia questions. Our next episode of Hit Parade is going to be about the career of, yes, Billy Joel, a man who is commonly known as the Piano Man, but who I prefer to refer to as the pastiche man four decades ago. Billy Joel topped the Hot 100 for the first time in 1981 with the song Still Rock and Roll to me. You mentioned it trivia questions, but it’s the 40th anniversary of that and his glasshouses album. And the interesting thing about Joel. Whether it’s that song or tell her about it, which we did mention, is that all of his number one songs are rather odd and none of them feature the piano prominently contrary to his common nickname. And, you know, throughout my life, growing up in New York City, where Joel was very popular, I’ve met Billy Joel haters and worshipers.

ADVERTISEMENT

S2: And here’s the thing on which all of us, the haters and the worshipers, can agree. Few hit ups tried on as many styles as he did. Joel has now been retired for more than a quarter century, even though he keeps playing concerts. Not currently, of course, under our Corona virus reality. But he’s been playing a series of shows here in New York City at the at the Garden, Madison Square Garden. So his hit making career has been at a standstill since the early 90s. But he was a hit maker to the end. And again, he did it by not sticking to any one thing, not even the instrument for which he is most famous. That’s gonna be our topic and our angle on the next episode of Hit Parade. I once again want to thank Eduardo Cepeda. I want to thank Tina for joining us for our trivia. This episode of Hit Parade. The bridge was produced by Show Soldier and coordinated by the head of Slate Live, Faith Smith. Huge thanks to her and her entire team for making this happen. And I’m xml laffy. Keep on marching on the one.
