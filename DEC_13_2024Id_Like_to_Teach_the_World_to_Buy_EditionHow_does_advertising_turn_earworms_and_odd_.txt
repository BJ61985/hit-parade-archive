Speaker A: I’d like to build the world a home and furnish it with love Grow apple trees and honeybees and snow white.

Speaker B: Turtle welcome to Hit Parade, a podcast of pop chart history from Slate magazine about the hits from coast to coast. I’m Chris Melanthy, chart analyst, pop critic and writer of Slate’s why Is this Song Number One? Series on Todays Show. 53 years ago, the week before Christmas 1971, two versions of the same song were racing each other up the Hot 100 pop chart. A version of the song by the British Australian group the New Seekers was at number 17. And just four spots below it, at number 21, was a version by a group that called itself the Hillside Singers.

Speaker A: I like to teach the world what sing one the perfectmonyfect of a song of peace goes on.

Speaker B: What made this perky sunshiny song such a hot commodity that Americans were buying competing versions?

Speaker C: The clue was in the name of the Hillside Singers.

Speaker B: They were named after a television commercial called Hilltop that advertised Coca Cola and in 1971 had taken pop culture by storm.

Speaker A: Keep it company real the world.

Speaker B: That’s right. The advertisement, not the group, came first. I’d like to Teach the World to Sing was specifically written for that Cokeh commercial. The melody had been around, but the lyrics were penned to sell carbonated caffeine. The commercial was a hit and it made the song a chart hit in its own right. And that wasn’t even the first time that had happened.

Speaker A: We only begun before the rising sun.

Speaker B: We fly over the decades, numerous songs have been made into hits through advertising, whether they were turned from ad jingles.

Speaker C: Into legitimate hits.

Speaker B: Its the weekend or hits that might have gone nowhere on the charts without an ad placement.

Speaker A: 3 takeap my hand and come with me because you look so fine that I really want to make you mind.

Speaker B: The fact is a catchy melody is.

Speaker C: A catchy melody and if it can be used to sell products.

Speaker B: One taste.

Speaker D: Will tell you why. The night belongs to Michel Lobe.

Speaker B: It can also be used to sell the artists latest album on the radio. The dance between the advertising industry and the Hit Parade has produced so many strange stories. There were pop hits that scaled the charts before anybody knew. They were advertising ad campaigns on both sides of the Atlantic that became as beloved as the hits they were rebooting.

Speaker A: Know Should I Stay Should I go?

Speaker B: If you say ads that turned formerly obscure artists into beloved pop deities, Zo.

Speaker A: Writt bingooon is hon.

Speaker B: Today on Hit Parade, we will tell some stories about the intersection of Madison Avenue and the penthouse of the hot 100. Dont feel too embarrassed if you enjoy these earworms that were trying to sell.

Speaker C: You cars, shoes, soda, beer or gum. As a legendary but fictional ad man.

Speaker A: Once said, advertising is based on one happiness.

Speaker B: And the pop charts. Theyre about happiness too. These stories are all a little crazy, but maybe none of them is crazier than the chart topping mid-70s fictional recording artist who was invented by an ad campaign he spawned not only a number one hit, but a Christmas music empire. Yes, seriously.

Speaker A: Hammer_E we got a little it’s your beautul sight.

Speaker B: And that’s where your hitip parade marches today, the week ending January 10, 1976. The end of the 1975 holiday season when C.W. mcCall topped the Hot 100 with his trucker and CB radio anthem Convoy. How did this smash grow out of a commercial for literally sliced bread? And how did it eventually lead to multiatinum holiday music that sounded like this? You cant make this up folks. The story of Convoy is the story of advertising and the charts. How kitsch and commerce collide to produce ditties that infiltrate our lives. So put on your warmest Christmas sweater, butter up some old home bread, pour yourself a coke and a smile and join us as we deck the halls with hits so jolly they got you.

Speaker C: To buy by bye.

Speaker A: Wake up in the morning There’a snap around the place Wake up in the morning there’s a crackle in your face.

Speaker B: Hey, have you heard this groovy 1964 recording by England’s newest hitkers, the Rolling Stones. This is a commercial for Kellogg’s Rice Krispies cereal recorded by the rock and roll combo that was just starting to compete with the Beatles on the charts.

Speaker A: Get up in the morning the says it re hear I’m talking Chris Rice Crispies.

Speaker B: Aired only in the UK in 64, this serial ad featured an original jingle called Jukebox, written by the band’own Brian Jones and sung by Mick Jagger. The Stones always did align themselves with the hard sell. Decades later, in 1981, they would raise eyebrows for signing the first major tour sponsorship with Jovann. Musk Perfume OFV Musk oil for Menauvin.

Speaker D: Musk oil for women.

Speaker C: So you might say the Stones sold out early. But in the world of mass culture.

Speaker B: What does it mean to sell out? My Slate colleague Willa Haskin explored this question in a superb episode of her always excellent podcast Decoder Ring, in which she dissected the very idea of selling out.

Speaker E: Okay, so I want to look at the history of the idea of selling out. And it’s a really big idea tangled up with a lot of other really big ideas like authenticity, purity, integrity, race, gender, and the entire history of art and commerce. In the second half of the 20th century, selling out becomes particularly contentious. Signing to a major label, licensing your music, corporate sponsorships, God forbid, doing a commercial will all give rise to accusations of selling out.

Speaker C: Seriously, I highly recommend the whole episode.

Speaker B: In which Willa explores everything from the.

Speaker C: Collision of daytime talk show queen Oprah Winfrey and literary author Jonathan Franzen to the Gen X movie Real Bites. For our purposes in this Hit Parade.

Speaker B: Episode, however, I remind you that this show is about art and commerce in the first place.

Speaker C: Ours is a show about the charts.

Speaker B: And the charts are full of singles that are themselves, in essence, advertisements for the album the act wants you to buy, for the tour they want you to attend, for the very idea that a band is the music business is, after all, a business. And sometimes the line between music publicity, which has been around from the beginning, and more craven synergy with Madison Avenue gets pretty blurry. I bring up the Stones because they are regarded as rock and roll icons, they legend untainted by their many dalliances with hard commerce. But lots of pop stars who were.

Speaker C: On the come up got their early breaks from the adbiz.

Speaker B: Luther Vandros, whom we discussed just last month in our Aretha Franklin episode, paid his bills before his big break by singing new numerous jingles.

Speaker C: Four brands ranging from Coca Cola to.

Speaker B: Kentucky Fried Chicken to Juicy Fruit Gum.

Speaker A: There’s nothing like a roller coaster ride there’s nothing like a view from a mile in the sky and theres nothing like the flavor of Juicy Fruit Gum.

Speaker B: Pick a pack of Juicy Fruit gum.

Speaker D: So sweet taste and fascinating so juicy.

Speaker B: Good Theres nothing out or pop legend Barry Manilow. He was not just a jingle singer. He wrote multiple jingles, and Il bet you know several of them because theyre earworms. This one, for example, is his handiwork.

Speaker A: I am stuck on Bananny Bragast Bandits upon me I am stuck on Band.

Speaker B: Aid cause Band Aid stuck on me.

Speaker A: Cause they hold are tight in back.

Speaker B: Manilo not only doesnt t shy away from his years of advertising work, in concert, he plays medleys of his jingles for the likes of Stridex, KFC and State F. How can we forget.

Speaker A: Whenever you’re driving and wherever you’bow like a good neighbor, State Farm is there.

Speaker B: Sure, these State Farm and Band Aid jingles are catchy.

Speaker C: In a parallel universe.

Speaker B: Theyre hits singable by millions, thanks to.

Speaker C: Years of TV exposure.

Speaker B: But theyre not full length standalone hit songs. Thats a special category. Songs that were conceived as advertisements but then became hits for real. What happens when jingles become hits?

Speaker C: Or when an advertisement plucks a legitimate.

Speaker B: Song from obscurity and makes it a smash?

Speaker C: To trace that history, we need to.

Speaker B: Go back to the middle of the 20th century and the prehistory of modern pop. Because this cross pollination between advertising and the charts is about as old as the recording industry itself. As far back as Tin Pan Alley, the border between hit songwriting and jingle writing was pretty thin and porous.

Speaker F: What they got in Omaha, they Califia BUTTERNUT co.

Speaker B: This Butternut coffee commercial was written and recorded by Stan Freberg, a comedy renaissance man who maintained parallel careers as a recording artist and advertising pitch man. He is widely credited for bringing humor and satire to advertising, and he won numerous CLO awards from his ad industry peers. But Stan Frbergs career as a recording artist came first.

ADVERTISEMENT

Speaker D: The legend you are about to hear is true. Only the needle should be changed to protect the record.

Speaker B: Freeberg was not a normal pop star. His singles were of the novelty variety, sometimes spoken word, sometimes melodic, virtually always farcical. But he was an actual hitmaker. Like his 1953 has one smash comedy record, St. George and the Dragonet, a parody of dragnet radio dramas. Or his silly musical deconstructions of genres like Do Wop on Shaboom, a top 20 hit in 1954.

Speaker A: Here go man.

Speaker B: Real monotonous.

Speaker D: Now.

Speaker A: Whos gota hang out in dinas.

Speaker B: Who stolngng Freeiburg was one of the earliest recording artists who normalized a pop career, coexisting alongside an advertising career. He brought his absurdist wit to both, but in a way, his ads were more serious than his songs. His slogan for Contadina tomato paste became indelible.

Speaker A: Who puts 8 gr great tomatoes in that little bitty? He can. You know who, you know who you know who.

Speaker D: In case you don’t, it’s Contadina tomato paste.

Speaker B: By the 1960s, other enterprising recording acts tried converting jingles into pop singles. It was a good decade for hit instrumentals, and a melody that was already familiar to the public from TV ads could go a long way on the charts. In 1965, for example, jazz bandleader Dave Pell thought that the melody of this Alka Seltzer commercial was catchy enough that he could turn it into a hit.

Speaker D: No matter what shape your stomach’s in, when it gets out of shape Take Alka Seltzer. Alka Seltzer relieves the flutters.

Speaker B: So Pell hired a few members of the celebrated rock and pop session musician team known as the Wrecking Crew. He renamed them the T Bone and they recorded a more polished version of the Alka Seltzer melody, titling the single no matter what shape your stomachs in after the Alka Seltzer adds tagline The T Bones one hit went all the way to number three in early 1966. Later that year, Bob Crew, who for years had written and produced hits for the Four Seasons, latched onto the melody in this Diet Pepsi ad. It was titled Music to Watch Girls by and the ad was about as dated to the 60s as that sounds.

ADVERTISEMENT

Speaker D: The kind of girl girl watchers watch. The kind of girl who keeps her figure, keeps her cool with the help of ice cold diet Pepsi cola. One bottle, one calorie and that honest of Pepsi taste.

Speaker B: Fortunately, those creepy diet Pepsi taglines did not make it into Bob Cruise instrumental remake of this Diditty, which he recorded as the Bob Crew Generation. His Music to Watch girls by reached has 15 in early 1967. Crews first ever top 40 hit under his own name. A couple of months later, this Benson and Hedges ad which was promoting a new extra long cigarette. Seriously, this was a thing you boasted about in the 60s had its own catchy melody.

Speaker D: O the disadvantages of the new Benson and Hedges 100s, theyre a lot longer than Kingside. And that takes him getting used to.

Speaker B: Producer arranger Phil Bodner’studio group which he called the Brass Ring, tried rebooting the cigarette ad and the disadvantages of you reached number 36 in March of 67. But arguably the golden age of the advertisement turned hit song was the 1970s. The decade kicked off with one of the finest examples of the form.

Speaker A: To live.

Speaker B: It all began when this ad for Crocker Citizens bank began airing in California. A San Francisco based advertising agency had commissioned a jingle to help Crocker appeal to young people. And the one minute commercial was rather poignant footage of a young couple getting married and just starting their lives together. Accompanied by a tune called Weve only just Begun. The jingle was sung by the man who co wrote it, journeyman songwriter Paul Williams. The ad caught the ear of Richard Carpenter, one half of the brother sister duo the Carpenters, who were assigned to the same label as Paul Williams. So Carpenter asked Williams if the song had more verses beyond what was in the ad. As it turned out, Williams and his songwriting partner had penned a Bridge and a third verse for a version of the song recorded by one Freddie Allenun. The Freddie Allen version was not a hit, but Richard Carpenter was convinced not only that the song was a hit, but that his sister Karen Carpenter’s vocals could bring it to life. So the Carpenters did their version, and Richard’s instincts were right. In November of 1970, on the radio show American Top 40, Casey Kasm counted it down.

Speaker G: The Bob Crew generation took the Pepsi commercial music entitled Music to Watch Girls by up to number 15 the charts back in 66. And in 1965, the T bones had a hit with the Elka Seltzer music entitled no Matter What Shape. And it got all the way up to number three. Well, now, in 1970, the Crocker citizens bank gives us the song that’s number two on the national charts, the highest position that a tune first used in a commercial has ever reached. Karen Carpenter sings it and Brother Richard is close by.

Speaker A: We’ve Only Just Begun to live white.

Speaker B: LA number two was as high as the carpenter’s version got on the hot 100. It got stuck behind the Jackson 5s I’ll be there. But the record was an instant soft rock classic that transcended its commercial origins. Paul Williams credits the song with breaking his career. And to this day, Richard Carpenter regards Weve Only Just Begun as the Carpenters signature hit. So does Rolling Stone magazine, by the way. Their critics ranked Weve only just begun 414th among their 500 greatest songs of all time.

Speaker A: Lear to run.

Speaker B: It was an auspicious start to the decade of the advertising crossover hit. And the 70s had, well, only just begun. The most iconic jingle turned hit appeared the very next year in 1971. Its iconic more for the commercial than for the song. But the song is pretty immortal too. One day in 1971, some executives at the famed ad agency McCann Erickson, who worked on the Coca Cola account, were stuck at an airport in Ireland due to some fog. And they observed as a group of formerly irate passengers who were also stuck waiting for the plane to take off, all cheered up when they shared a few sodas. One of the executives said hed like to buy the world a Coke. When his colleague said if I could do something for everybody in the world, it would not be to buy them a Cokeque. I’d buy everyone a home first and share with them in peace and love. The ad team had a brainstorm that they could combine both ideas and turn them into a jingle like the world.

Speaker A: Of Come Keep It Company is the real thing.

ADVERTISEMENT

Speaker B: The result of this brainstorm would be the ad that is now storied in the annals of advertising history, Hilltop. It was both a radio ad and, much more famously, a TV commercial. In the TV version, a rainbow coalition of people from around the world sing together on a sunny hillside in Italy while holding bottles of Coca Cola. Just how legendary is this commercial in the world of advertising? So much so that in the final moments of the series finale of TV’s Mad Men, showrunner Matthew Weiner fictionalized the story of Hilltop, imagining that deceptive adman Don Draper dreamed it up while meditating at a retreat.

Speaker A: Id like to buy the world a home and furnish it with love Grow apple trees and hies be the white turtle do.

Speaker B: As for the song in the commercial I’d like to teach the world to sing parentheses in perfect harmony. It grew out of a melody that songwriters Roger Cook and Roger Greenaway first wrote for singer Susan Shirley. Shirley’s early version was called True Love and Apple pie prom no diamond rings.

Speaker A: In the sky Just to read things like mony for True Love and that.

Speaker B: The songwriters hired by McCann Erickson kept that melody but swapped in new lyrics about buying the world a home and filling it with love. And of course, buying the world a Coke. For the radio jingle the songwriters recorded with pop group the New Seekers, who were on a bit of a role in 1971. The quintet of British and Australian singers, a Successor band to 60s hitmakers the Seekers had just scored a number 14 hit in 1970 with a cover of look what They’d Done to My Song.

Speaker A: Ma look what they done to my brain Look.

Speaker B: The New Seekers recorded the original radio jingle with the lyrics about Coca Cola. By the time the TV commercial hit the airwaves, I’d like to Teach the World to Sing had become a full blown cultural phenomenon, with radio listeners calling their local stations to request the commercial. It fit right in at the peak of inspirational hippie pop. You may recall from past episodes of Hip parade that in 1971 the Jesus Christ Superstar theatrical album was very popular.

Speaker A: And I’ve had so many met before.

Speaker B: Anyway, given the Koch adds popularity, the team behind the song decided by the summer of 71 to release it as a single with product references removed from the lyrics. At the time, though, the New Seekers were unavailable to go back into the studio, so McCann Erickson quickly assembled a studio group, which they called the Hillside Singers, in a shameless bid to evoke the beloved TV commercial Hilltop. Their twangy version of the single was actually released first I d Like to.

Speaker A: Teach the world to sing Imperfect harmony.

Speaker B: Meanwhile, the New Seekers who were touring America toward the end of 71, found time to get into a studio and record their own version. Soon both the Hillside Singers and the New Seekers were competing head to head on the charts.

Speaker A: I Like to Teach I? D Like to ha it in since.

Speaker B: The New Seekers naturally sounded more like the commercial, after all, theyd recorded the original version. Theirs proved to be the bigger hit. By January 1972, I? D like to Teach the World to Sing by the New Seekers peaked on the Hot 100 at number seven. The same week the Hillside Singers version reached its peak of number 13. If the two singles hadnt split the market, the song could well have been a top five or even a number one hit, all thanks to a TV commercial.

Speaker A: Like to Hold My Arms.

ADVERTISEMENT

Speaker B: By the way, in the uk the New Seekers version of I’d like to Teach the World to Sing actually was a number one hit and it must have made quite an impression on future Oasis songwriter Noel Gallagher. Decades later, he lets say, borrowed its melody for the verse of the Oasis hit Shaker Maker. After the success of the Coca Cola jingle turned New Seekers hit, it was now more common for hit songs to invoke consumer products and vice versa. In 1973, Paul Simon titled a hit song Kodachhrome after the color film development system used by photography company Kodak.

Speaker A: Give those nice bright colors give the.

Speaker B: Green Coodachhrome reached number two on the Hot 100 in the summer of 73. Paul Simon was legally compelled by Kodak to include fine print on his records, indicating that Kodachrome was a registered trademark of the company. What was funny was a couple of years later crooner Paul Anka turned an actual jingle 4 Kodak into a top 10 hit.

Speaker A: Suddenly its hard to find the memory you left behind. Remember.

Speaker B: REM times of your life, which Anka recorded specifically for Kodak in 75, was popular enough that Anka remade it as a full length single. That version reached number seven on the Hot 100 in early 76.

Speaker A: One by Oneather mom collect Dre Dre.

Speaker B: Around the same time, a British singer, songwriter and jingleriter named David Dundas took a full length version of his jingle jeans on to number 17 on the Hot 100. Many Americans were not even familiar with the British brand Brutus genes that the tune was promoting.

Speaker A: Pull my blue jeans.

Speaker B: On myue jeans on but without question, the oddest 70s pop hit created via advertising was the aforementioned single by C.W. mcCall, an artist who wasn’t even real. Technically, the number one hit that resulted from this artifice wasn’t an ad in itself. But without advertising, the whole thing never would have happened in the first place. It all started with this 1973 ad for a Midwestern brand called Old Home Bred.

ADVERTISEMENT

Speaker F: Well, trucking old Home I was working a blizzard she is colder in the Minnesota well Diggers gizard eyes up to my drivehaft and 18 inches of slush Heavy white stuff I had a jack knife and rig that drove like a sled Had a busted chain and a load of bread for the old home Filler up and keep on the trucking cafe.

Speaker B: The ad was the handiwork of Bill Freeze, creative director for an Omaha ad agency. He built the Old Home campaign around a character he named C.W. mcCall, a trucker who loved bread. The CW stood for country and Western. Frze even voiced the character himself in a kind of speak see country rap style. And a jingle wrter named Chip Davis did the music a teleph post But.

Speaker F: Mavis and me hed d warm his toast Let the old home filler up and keep on the trucking cafe yeah, Old Home is good bread.

Speaker B: The Old Home ad was so popular across the Midwest, Fries and Davis decided they should release the jingle as a single. It just so happened that Chip Davis had a relatively easy way to do this. In 1974, Davis founded American Gramophone, an Omaha based indie label that he launched mostly to release his own instrumental music. A synthesizer classical fusion project that he called Mannheim Steamroller. Remember that name, Mannheims Steamroller will be an interesting footnote later. Anyway, in the summer of 74, Chip Davis put out the debut single by Bill Fres character CW McCall. A full length version of the old Home bred jingle called Old Home Filler up and keep a truckin Cafe.

Speaker F: Then I went inside she says, what’ll it be? It says a cup of your best and a number three she came back with an order to go in a quart of hot sea in a bone for Sloane I said much obliged Don’t Sloan give a bark I left her a buck and he left his heart at the old home Feller up and keep on a trucking cafe.

Speaker B: The single on Davis American gramophone label sold 30,000 copies in just a few weeks and peaked on the Hot 100 at number 54. Impressive for a Midwestern regional hit. The major label MGM Records took notice and signed C.W. mcCall to provide national distribution. That’s when Frze and Davis teamed up to write a new single for the McCall character called Convoy by The time.

Speaker F: We got into Tulsa town we had 85 trucks and all. But there’s a roadb blck up on the cloverleaf and them bears is wall to wall yeah, them smok is as thick as bugs on a bumper. They even had a bear in the air. I said calling all trucks, this here is the duck we about to go a hunting bear.

Speaker B: They were jumping onto a FAD, the mid-70s citizens band or CB radio FAD that had spread from long haul truckers to regular hobbyists. CB enthusiasts saw themselves as freedom fighters out on the open road fighting tolls, way stations and the 55 mile an hour speed limit. And they communicated on their radios with CB slang, avoiding bears and smokies, AKA state troopers, putting the hammer down to pick up speed. And they coined nicknames for themselves like Rubber Duck in the song CW as Rubber Duck is leading a convoy of trucks. Though the song wasnt actually advertising anything, the chorus, the only part sung melodically by a radio style troupe sounded a lot like ad jingle music.

Speaker A: Cause we got great big conoy walk into the night yeah, we got great big convoy Ain’you a beautiful sight. Come on and join our card.

Speaker B: You might say that in the tradition of Stan Freeibberg, Convoy was a novelty record that used advertising technique to capture the zeitgeist. And it was a smash on both the pop and country char charts just before Christmas 1975. Probably benefiting from Americans whod just gotten their first CB radios for the holiday, convoy reached number one on billboards hot country singles chart and settled in for a six week run on top. Which was kind of funny because Chip Davis declared that he didnt even like country music. Then just after the holiday season in early January 1976, Convoy reached has one on the Hot 102.

ADVERTISEMENT

Speaker F: I says pink pen, this here’s a rubber dug. We just ain’t going to pay no toll so we crashed the gate due 98 as this let them truckers roll 10 4.

Speaker B: Convoy was a phenomenon. It spawned a movie two years later starring Chris Christristoheron and Ali McGraw and directed by Sam Pecknpaw. The Convoy movie grossed nearly $50 million at the box office. But the most interesting footnote of the C.W. mcCall trendlet was how it helped launch the musical career of Chip Davis, who ultimately became better known for his other project, Mannheim Steamroller. The pop classical project Davis released on his American gramophone label alongside C.W. mcCall started issuing Christmas music in the 80s and that music proved more popular than any of Davis other seasonal releases for generations of middle Americans. Mannheim’s Steamroller is now the Sound of Christmas. Their holiday albums are all platinum or multi platinum. Talk about successful marketing. And it all grew out of an ad campaign for sliced bread. By the 80s, the connection between advertising and popular music had been supercharged. Brands like Pepsi were now paying pop stars like Michael Jackson, Lionel Ritchie, David Bowie, Tina Turner and Madonna millions to adapt their hits into TV jingles. Michael Jackson was also part of the biggest musical advertising controversy of the decade. The sale of the Beatles song Revolution to Nike for a 1987 sneaker commercial. Jackson then owned the Beatles publishing and he approved the sale of the song for use in the ad for half a million dollars. Reportedly, John Lennons widow Yoko Ono also approved the sale, which the media at the time pilloried as the ultimate sellout of baby boomer musical iconography. Perhaps the strangest 80s appropriation of 60s pop was a series of animated ads for the Raisin Growers association that featured a group of anthropomorphic claymation raisins singing a cover of the Motown classic I Heard it through the Grapevine. The ads were so weirdly popular, the California Raisins recorded a series of albums of R and B covers, went platinum in 1988 and even took their cover of the Marvinay hit into the hot 100.

Speaker D: California raisins.

ADVERTISEMENT

Speaker B: But all of these were high profile uses of pre existing pop hits repurposed as advertising. Actual jingles that turned into hit songs were more rare by the 80s, given the debates raging over baby boomer sellout and rock and roll authenticity. In 1987, Sting sneaked a jingle onto the charts by penning it for a Japanese commercial for Kieran Beer. The Kiran ad only aired in Japan, making it at the time essentially invisible to western listeners. When Sting re recorded that jingle well’ll be together for his acclaimed album Nothing like the sun, the Funky Diddy became a hit peaking on the Hot 100 at number seven in December of 87. Together higher profile was a series of ads for Michelo Beer that did air in America and involved new recordings by Rock and Roll hall of Famers. The campaign kicked off with a sleek ad featuring guitar virtuoso Eric Clapton who re recorded his 1970 solo hit after Midnight.

Speaker A: Give an exhibition, find out what is about.

Speaker D: The night belongs to Michelo.

Speaker B: Though rock heads at the time groused about the very 80s reboot and the spectacle of Clapton appearing in a beer commercial. The re Recorded After Midnight was a rock radio hit, reaching number four on Billboard’s album rock chart in early 88 then within a few months, Michelob dropped an ad featuring a totally new song by former Traffic frontman, now solo superstar Steve Winwood.

Speaker A: Dont you know I can do.

Speaker B: One.

Speaker D: Taste will tell you why the night.

Speaker B: Belongs to Michelo Dont you know what the knight can do sounded so much like a beer commercial that the media didnt believe Winwood when he claimed the song was written before the Michelo deal was struck. Nevertheless, Winwoods beer ad helped his song scale the charts too. In the fall of 88, the full length what the Nightight can do reach number one at album rock and number six on the Hot 100.

Speaker A: Do.

Speaker B: To date. Through the 60s, 70s and 80s, most jingles turned hits were either one off singles that were hard to follow up, from the t bones to CW McCall or they were by established rock legends who probably would have kept having hits anyway. ##way as the ad industry entered the 90s and approached the 21st century, the still unanswered question was whether advertising could not only make a hit, but redefine an artists career. Soon enough this hypothesis would be tested too. One of the most interesting experiments in music forward advertising happened on the other side of the atlant. Starting in the late 80s, Levis’s Genesans began producing ads in England that licensed prominent pop songs. At first the campaign leaned on old rock and R and B songs.

Speaker A: Historylog.

Speaker B: Levis kicked off the series with an ad featuring a cover of the Sam Cook classic Wonderful World playing over footage of a hunky shirtless male model shrinking his Levis 501 jeans by wearing them in a full bathtub. The ads sent Cook’original version of Wonderful World back up the UK charts in 1986, where it peaked at number two. One year later, another Levis Geneans advert featuring Stand By Me sent that Ben E. King classic all the way to number one in the UK for the.

Speaker A: First time dling stand.

Speaker B: This kicked off a half decade of number one bringb back hits in the UK spawned by Levi’s adverts. British TV viewers actually began looking forward to the ads which featured cheeky plots and handsome models in Levi’s. A motorcycle riding hunk disrupts an office with his chopper, for example.

Speaker C: Or a dude in a billiards hall.

Speaker B: Bets an old pool shark he can win a game or one of them has to remove his pants. And the classic songs featured in the.

Speaker C: Ads routinely scaled the UK charts.

Speaker B: Among the oldies that topped the official British chart for the first time thanks to Levis, were the Steve Miller bands The Joker, a 1973 recording that went to number one UK in 1990.

Speaker C: And.

Speaker B: Should I Stay or Should I Go? A 1982 track by the Clash that topped the UK chart in 1991. Soon, other advertisers hopped on this bring back bandwagon. In 1989, a Millerite beer ad sent the Hollies 1969 single He Ain’Heavy Hes My Brother to number one in England for the first time. And a 1993 ad for the Volkswagen Golf licensed the Bluebell’1984 version of Young at Heart, sending that song to number one. Gradually, the licensed songs were moving closer to the present day. Eventually, the Levis ad campaign started licensing songs by contemporary artists and still having the same chart success. In 1994, the Denim Company licensed a grunge song by the largely unknown band Stiltskin called Inside. The Scottish group had never had a hit, but the Levi’s ad sent inside to number one in the UK in May of 94.

Speaker A: Ive been losing my way Thats because.

Speaker B: I blinder Stiltskin had trouble capitalizing on their success, never coming close to the top of the charts again. But a year later, dancehall artist Orville Burrel, better known to the world as Shaggy, solidified his career thanks to a Levi’advert Shaggy licensed his regified pop song Boomastic for a comical animated Levis’ad in which a claymation hunk saves a woman from a burning building through the power of his genes. Boom B****** not only top the charts around the world in countries that broadcast the Levis ad, it established Shaggy as a regular hitmaker. He even started scoring hits in America.

Speaker A: That the girls stareimate.

ADVERTISEMENT

Speaker B: The decade long Levi’campaign showed not only that advertisements were a powerful means for reviving songs, they could redefine an artist in the public imagination. In America in the 90s, advertisers were just starting to pick up on the idea of reviving golden oldies. One of the most celebrated commercials of the Decade appeared in 1998 advertising a line of khakis for retail chain the Gap. Picking up on the swing dancing revival that had been growing as a pop fad since the 1996 movie Swingers. The ad featured a troupe of young dancers in khakis dancing athletically with leaping and high kicking steps. The eye catching ad used a then new camera technique to freeze the dancers in mid air and pivot around them. This was a full year before the movie the Matrix would make Bullet Time famous. And most alluringly, the dancers were swinging to a classic jump blues song from Louis Prima called Jump, jive and wail.

Speaker A: Then you really gott jump driving Then you really gotta jump jiving Then you really gota jump jiving Then you you gott jump driving and you went.

Speaker B: Prima’s jam had never charted in its original incarnation, but the 98 Gap ad had an unusual chart effect a cultural bank shop that benefited an artist who had nothing to do with either the ad or the original song. Brian setzer, formerly of 80s rockabilly band the Stray Cats, Scream Shadow, had switched to swing music in the 90s, just ahead of the swing fad. Talk about right place, right time. His 1998 album, credited to the Brian Setzer Orchestra, called the Dirty Boogie, released just weeks after the Gap ad dropped, included a cover of Jump, Jive and Whil. By the fall of 98, the CD broke into the top 10 and went double plat, and the Setzer orchestras rocking and swinging version of the Louis Prima song reached the top 30 on Billboards Hot 100 airplay chart. The Setzer cover and the Gap ad were mutually commercially benefiting each other.

Speaker A: B Looks likea Help Insive Way youa.

Speaker B: But perhaps the most potent TV commercial at the turn of the millennium from a musical standpoint came in 1999 when German carmaker Volkswagen revived a truly obscure British folk pop artist from the early 70s. Really the word revive doesn’t even capture it to most listeners. This artist might as well have been new and hed been gone for over a quarter century.

Speaker A: I have been a been a real lover, could been.

Speaker B: By the time Nick Drake died in 1974 at age 26 from an overdose of antidepressants, he regarded his career as a failure. None of his albums he recorded only three in his brief lifetime had charted anywhere either in America or in his native England. Painfully shy, Drake had a pathological fear of performing live and he suffered from crippling depression. But he was a unique guitarist with a jazzy, long fingered playing style and a sterling songwriter whose hushed rustic music anticipated later waves of indie rock. The exquisitely beautiful LPs Nick Drake produced between 1969 and 1972 were treasured by a devoted cult audience, most especially his final album, 1970 twos stark, melancholy pink Moon. Among the cult of Nick Drake fans was a team of young creators directors at a Boston ad agency. In the late 1990s they drafted a treatment for an ad for their client Volwagen for the carmakers Cabriolet convertible. The ad took place at night and depicted a group of friends riding in the car with the top down after dark. Wordlessly gazing at the stars. This was unusual. Convertible car ads typically took place in bright sunshine. When they originally conceived of the dreamy moonlit ad, the Boston team pictured it being soundtracked by Australian band the Church’s 1988 top 30 hit under the Milky Way. Hence they titled the VW ad Milky Way.

Speaker A: I wa wish I knew whatew were.

Speaker B: But under the Milky Way had already been a hit. The Boston team was aiming the ad at a millennial audience, buying their first car and discovering their own music. So they landed instead on the title track of Nick Drake’ Pink Moon lp. The Drake found family had never approved the use of Nicks music in an ad before, but Nicks sister Gabrielle Drake was charmed by the Milky Way ads quiet atmosphere of hushed wonder when the commercial debuted on TV in the closing weeks of 1999, thousands of Americans suddenly discovered Nick Drake. According to critic Amanda Petrusich, who wrote a book for the 33 and a third series on Drake’s Pink Moon album, sales of Drake’s LP grew by nearly 500% in the weeks immediately after the ads debuted. By the end of the year 2000, Pink Moon was selling more than 70,000 copies a year, a staggering sum for a previously cult level artist. Eventually, when the LP was reissued on vinyl in 2013, Pink Moon finally made a Billboard chart, peaking at number seven on the vinyl albums chart. In a retrospective 2016 Boston Globe article on the creation of the Milky Way ad, a member of the advertising team says the choice of Nick Drake quote, helped to shift television commercials into an era of tast making through advertising. The trend of spending millions on Michael Jackson’songs began taking a backseat to commercials featuring lesser known artists.

Speaker C: Unquote.

Speaker B: In other words, advertising could now turn cult music into popular culture.

Speaker C: In 2001 the next phase of music marketing took hold when Apple launched its ipod music player, the must have gadget of the augts.

Speaker B: Ipod A thousand songs.

Speaker C: In your pocket it is difficult to overstate what a cultural watershed this palm sized click wheel music player was. The ipod converted Apple, which was making a comeback under returned CEO Steve Jobs from a computer company to an all around electronics and lifestyle company. It introduced mobile technologies that later in the decade would blossom in the even more transformative iPhone and it branded Apple as the nexus of cool that was most visible during the aughts in the series of TV commercials Apple produced for the ipod. The iconic silhouette ad campaign Buy eas.

Speaker A: Fix it, Trash it, Cand it, Mail.

Speaker C: The ads featured shadowy figure against primary colored backgrounds jamming to their favorite tunes with contrasting bright white ipods in their hands and white wired earbuds in their ears, and each commercial was built around a different single song. The ads helped Apple sell millions of ipods, but as with Levi’s UK ads from a decade earlier, the breakout star of the commercials arguably wasnt the dancing silhouettes or even the shiny ipods. It was the songs. In the early days of the ipod campaign, many of the ads featured songs by relatively well known musical acts like Daft Punk or Ned Pharrell Williams rock band side Project but the real indicator of the impact the ads were having was how they broke baby bands acts that had never had an American chart hit before. Caesars, for example, a Swedish rock foursome, scored their first and only top 40 alternative radio chart hit in 2005 after their song Jerk it out was featured in an ipod shuffle ad. An even more remarkable example was the Australian rock band Jet.

Speaker A: 1, 2, 3 takeap my hand to come with me because you look so fine that I really wa wantna make you mind Find that I reallyn to make you mind.

Speaker C: Jets album Get Born had been out for several months before an ipod ad featuring their are you gonna be my girl?

Speaker B: Dropped.

Speaker C: Thats when the song crossed over to the Hot 100. At a time when few rock bands were breaking on pop radio, both the song and the album cracked the top 30 and Get Born went platinum Roote the album chart for nearly two years and spun off two more hits. Apples showcase of Jet had broken the band in America.

Speaker A: Knees I Wait and Give Mech Goerrillas.

Speaker C: Blur frontman Damon Albarnes’pop hip hop side project was also boosted by an Apple ad. The quirky group had never cracked the American top 40 before. Gorillas song Feel Good in was used in an especially memorable ipod ad featuring roller skating silhouettes that boosted the track with vocals by veteran rappers De La soul into the top 40, where it reached number 14. Eventually, the silhouette ads began embracing veteran acts alongside the newbies, a sure sign of the campaigns cultural penetration. In these commercials, the Silhouettes were of the band members themselves, with just enough light on their faces so you could see the famous person singing.

Speaker A: Let.

Speaker C: As we discussed a couple of months ago in our U2 edition of Hit Parade, after the stalwart Irish rockers licensed their single Vertigo for an ipod ad, the.

Speaker B: Band saw its biggest sales week ever.

Speaker C: The how to Dismantle an Atomic Bomb album opened to a staggering 840,000 in sales. Two years later, even more remarkably, no less a figure than Bob Dylan appeared.

Speaker B: In an ipod Adday Baby you a.

Speaker A: Gon Way for Me.

Speaker C: And the folk rock legend was rewarded with his first number one album in 30 years. Dillan’Two Thousand Six disc Modern Times rolled 192,000 in sales in its debut, his best sales week ever, and became Dyons first album to reach the chart throne since his Desire LP in 1976. Longtime Dylan fan Steve Jobs was reportedly very happy at having helped his hero. Two years later, an Apple ad delivered a number one on the Hot 100 Songs chart for the first time.

Speaker A: Chesh the Bel_man Caies.

Speaker C: Coldplay were not exactly hurting on the charts. By 2008, their previous album, X and Y had gone to number one and sold 3 million copies in the U.S. but Coldplay had never scored an American number one single. That changed after Viva La Vida, a single available exclusively for download at Apple itunes, sold a quarter million downloads and climbed all the way to the top of the Hot 100. By the time of Coldplays victory, Apples prowess on the charts was no longer dependent on the Silhouette campaign. Apple could basically advertise anything prominently, feature a song in the ad and see it fly up the charts. In 2007, indie pop singer Feist saw her career utterly rebooted when Apple Featured her folky didy 1 2, 3, 4 in an ad for the ipod Nano. A product ad showing off the Nanos new video feature played Feist chipper music video on the tiny screen. Indie acts like Feist normally went nowhere on the Hot 100, but the week after the iPod Nano ad launched, 1 2, 34 shot into the pop top 40, then vaulted into the top 10, driven mostly by download sales at itunes. Feist’hit peaked at number eight.

Speaker A: You changing heart you know who you are 1, 2, 3.

Speaker C: A few months later, in an even.

Speaker B: Quirkier move, I’m a new soul.

Speaker A: I came to this strange world hoping I could learn a bit about how to give and take.

Speaker C: Apple launched its ultralight MacBook Air laptop line with an ad that featured Israeli singer Yael Naim’s stark piano ballad New Soul. The indie pop Feist had at least had some meager prior Billboard chart history. Naim recorded for a French label and had never touched the American charts before. But the anointing by Apple caused New Soul to debut on the Hot 100 all the way up at number nine, an instant top 10 hit spurred entirely by Steve Jobs minions. The impact of Apples song showcasing ads.

Speaker B: Finally started to wane toward the end.

Speaker C: Of The Augts, a 2008 iPod silhouette ad featuring British rock duo the Ting Tings only got their song Shut up and Let Me Go as high as number 55 on the Hot 100 and number 34 on the Alternative rock chart.

Speaker A: Now I go easily be done Is it me the AR to be moving on your no and I want something.

Speaker C: Un inableaking but no ad campaign had ever made more hits on the US Charts than Apples had, from grizzled veterans to young indie acts and total unknowns. And that was before most Americans even owned a smartphone.

Speaker B: In the spring of 2008, just as Apple was winding down its Silhouette ad campaign, a new Chris Brown single debuted on the Hot 100. It was called Forever, and it sounded like a quintessential Chris Brown R and B inflected dance pop song.

Speaker A: 2.

ADVERTISEMENT

Speaker B: Because Brown was at the peak of his hit making popularity. This, by the way, was a year before he pleaded guilty to assaulting his girlfriend, Rihanna. The song began scaling the Hot 100 as Forever blanketed the radio. Fans couldnt t help but notice that the chorus of the song included an oddly familiar line from the world of advertising. It was an allusion to a slogan the Wrigley Company had coined decades before for their flagship gum brand, Doublementt. Wrigley had used this tagline in Doublementt ads as far back as the 1960s.

Speaker A: Double your pleasure, double your fun with double good appble good appble min gum.

Speaker B: By mid July, the Chris Brown song had reached number four on the Hot 100. That’s when the Wrigley Company made an announcement that stunned the media and pop fans. The song was an ad Wrigley had commissioned Chris Brown and his production team to write Forever with the Gums slogan embedded in the song, and they planned to start airing a shorter version. In a series of TV adverts, Wrigley and Brown had infiltrated the charts with a stealth commercial. The blogosphere was outraged. A Gawker headline screamed Boycott Wrigley. If you ever want to hear real music again again. One betrayed writer who blogged about the media industry wrote, Id joined the boycotters myself. If I were a Wrigley Gum consumer in the first place, you can bet I dont plan on becoming one anytime soon. For now Ill just avoid a song I once really, really likedot. The so called boycott didnt amount to much. By August, Forever had climbed all the way to number two on the Hot 100, becoming one of Chris Brown’biggest hits. One year later, a YouTube video went viral of a wedding party performing an intricately choreographed dance up the aisle to Chris Browns Forever. The viral video became such a popular meme. A few months later, the dance up the aisle to Forever was lovingly recreated on the Jim and Pam wedding episode of NBC’s hit sitcom the Office.

Speaker A: I know you specifically put this song on your do not playlist.

Speaker B: Yes, I did.

Speaker A: I’m sorry. Go ahead.

Speaker B: I think it’s your turn.

Speaker A: Wait, what happened? You. You okay with this? Yeah, I’m okay.

Speaker B: O.

Speaker A: Did you see this? It was on YouTube.

Speaker B: In short, any lingering bad taste from the song’commercial origins, to say nothing of Chris Browns tarnished reputation by 2009 had been wiped away like weve ve Only Just Begun or any number of other jingles turned hits. Forever was now enjoyed unynically as a love song and a meme. This seems to be the fate of any song popularized by advertising, especially as the streaming era has made profiting from recordings ever more challenging. Fewer artists seem to view licensing a song to an advertisement as selling out, whether it’s the Grammy winning band fun led by Nate Rus and Jack Antonov, whose 2012 breakthrough hit We Are Young was made famous by a Chevrolet ad that aired prominently during that years Super Bowl. Just weeks after the ad debuted, We Are young topped the hot 100. Or the alt rock band Ex Ambassadors, whose Renegades was licensed for a commercial for the Jeep Renegade suv. The vehicle and the song name were supposedly coincidental. In 2015, the advertising SinkC made Renegades, the New York Foursomes biggest hit, has 17 on the Hot 100 and number one on the Alternative rock chart. Or rapper Travis Scott, who has never been shy about mixing commerce with his art. In 2020, he partnered with McDonalds for a promotion by creating his own limited time Travis Scott meal combo with a wink. He then titled his next single franchise A Team up with fellow rappers Young Thug and MIA. The single debuted at number one on the Hot 100 that fall. In all cases, these hits have gone down in chart history as highlights of the respective artists catalog, unsullied by their affiliation with Madison Avenue. Mind you, there remains some stigma against mixing commerce into the art. Not since the Chris Brown Wrigleys gambit of 2008 has a stealth ad jingle scaled the charts with quite that level of subterfuge. That taint is probably a good thing. But as long as there have been hits, certain songs have started out selling products before they sold themselves. A good song is a good song, like for example, the bank jingle that songwriter Paul Williams bequeathed to the carpenters back in 1970. Paul Williams still performs this song in concert and talks about how it changed his life. Here he is a decade ago at Nashvilles Bluebird Cafe. That song has improved a lot of lives since 1970, even if some of those folks first discovered it during a station break.

Speaker A: And before the rising sun we fly.
